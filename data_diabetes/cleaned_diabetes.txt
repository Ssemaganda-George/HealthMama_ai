this issue of obstetric and gynecology clinic of north america   guest edit by janice bacon   md and paul tomich   md   deal with topic of clinical importance to the
obstetrician gynecologist for maintenance of knowledge   this issue result from a
popular postgraduate course repeat at the american college of obstetrician and
gynecologist annual clinical and scientific meeting   a portion of lecture material
include topic present in this issue   vaginitis beyond the basic   abnormal uterine
bleed   recognition of therapy for cervix and uterine malignancy   prenatal
diagnostic screening   gestational diabetes   hypertension   peripartum obstetric emergency   menopausal transition   common breast disorder   and recognize and manage common urogynecologic disorder  
maintenance of knowledge be critical for physician performance improvement and
maintenance of certification   moc    the goal of the moc process   as prepare by
the american board of obstetric and gynecology   abog    be to improve patient
safety   this process help to assure that diplomate be maintain a high level of current medical knowledge   and appropriately apply that information in their practice  
like this abog process   information report in this issue be develop to enable
physician to maintain a high standard of current medical knowledge and safety  
in each year of a 6 year recertification cycle   diplomate must complete a number of
task   include read current literature and answer question about the content  
and perform a quality improvement activity   in select year   specific training in
medical safety be include   and at the end of each cycle   a secure write examination
must be pass   in addition   abog carefully review all adverse action against physician   as diplomate be require to hold and maintain an unrestricted license to
practice medicine  
several past registrant have retake this course due to its value in reconfirming and
update their knowledge about standard subject   include cost containment and
potential patient safety   this issue bring to the reader the most current knowledge

remain current and up to date in today s rapidly expand world of medical advance be challenge to all physician   provide efficient and appropriate clinical
care   medical cost containment   and the potential to improve patient safety have
also be aspect of continue medical education endeavor  
in 2000   the us medical specialty board adopt maintenance of certification
  moc    a program incorporate education and assessment research and implementation as part of a quality improvement framework recognize physician performance as
a crucial contributor to health outcomes   moc focus on the core competency of
the american board of medical specialty   abms   and the accreditation council for
graduate medical education   include professionalism   lifelong learning and selfassessment   cognitive expertise   and performance in practice  
the american board of obstetric and gynecology   a found organization of the
abms   develop a 6 year plan for maintenance of certification for obstetrician
and gynecologist culminate in a standardized exam in year six  
to meet the need of physician desire review and current information within the
broad specialty of obstetric and gynecology   the american college of obstetric and
gynecology begin present maintenance of knowledge course each year at their
annual clinical meeting   topic present in the course allow physician to receive
current information in many area of the specialty for review and preparation for the
exam in year six   these course also attract physician who simply want update
in a variety of topic and for resident or graduate prepare for their oral board
exam  
this issue of obstetric and gynecology clinic of north america include topic
from the maintenance of knowledge course with succinct information helpful to

   clinical breast examination be recommend every 1 to 3 year from age 20 to 39 year
and annually begin at age 40 year by the american college of obstetrician and gynecologist   acog   and national comprehensive cancer network  
   acog recommend a genetic risk assessment for woman with a great than 20   to 25  
chance of have an inherit predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer  
   the evaluation of a breast mass begin with a detailed history   assessment for breast cancer risk   and physical examination  
 
incidence
 
breast cancer be predict to be the most common newly diagnose cancer in woman
in 2016   as it be in 2015   the estimate number of new case for 2016 be 246 660 1
with the estimate of 231 840 in 2015 2 base on these estimate   breast cancer account for 29   of all cancer in woman for both year 1 2 the estimate number of
death from breast cancer in woman also be effectively unchanged   with 40 290 occur in 20152 and 40 450 in 2016 1
the probability of develop invasive breast cancer from 2010 to 2012 be 1 9   1 in

  white    hispanic   and american indian alaska native   ai an   woman   overall   white
and black woman have a high incidence and death rate from breast cancer than
woman of other race ethnicitie   the median age for the diagnosis of breast cancer
in woman be 61 year   with the median age of 58 year for black woman and 62 year
for white woman   the incidence of breast cancer also vary between state   for
example   the incidence of breast cancer among woman in arkansa be 107 7 per
100 000 woman   whereas it be 164 4 case per 100 000 woman in washington  
dc among white woman   in black woman the incidence vary from 94 per 100 000
woman in minnesota to 141 7 per 100 000 woman in alaska 3
base on the surveillance   epidemiology and end result   seer   program   the incidence of invasive breast cancer decrease by 0 5   from 1975 to 1980   increase by
4   from 1980 to 1987   decrease by 0 2   from 1987 to 1994   increase by 1 8  
from 1994 to 1999   decrease by 2 3   from 1999 to 2004   and increase by 0 4  
from 2004 to 2013   fig   1   4
breast cancer be predict to be the lead cause of death from cancer among
woman age 20 to 59 year and the second lead cause of death for all woman
in 2016 1 the median age for death from breast cancer be 68 year   with the age of
62 year for black woman and 70 year for white woman 3
the cancer intervention and surveillance model network   cisnet   report a
decrease in the death rate from breast cancer from 1975 to 2000   the rate of death
 
fig   1   trend in the seer program observe incidence and we mortality for invasive female
breast cancer for all age and race from 1975 through 2015  
 
 
cancer recognition and screen
 
from breast cancer adjust for age to the 2000 population be 48 3 death per
100 000 woman age 30 to 79 year in 1975   by 1990 the rate be slightly increase
to 49 7 per 100 000 but then it decrease to 38 per 100 000 by 2000   which be a
decrease of 24   from 1990 5 another study document a decrease in breast cancer
death by 36   from 1989 to 2012 3
the annual percentage change in the mortality from invasive breast cancer
decrease by 1 3   from 1992 to 1995   decrease by 3 5   from 1995 to 1998   and
decrease by 1 9   from 1998 to 2013 4
the trend for the incidence of female breast cancer have the great increase between 1980 and 1987   however   there have be minimal change since then   meanwhile   the incidence of mortality from invasive breast cancer have continue to
decline since 1975   most consistently since 1990   one report suggest that the incidence be more closely relate to trend in factor that affect the cause   whereas mortality be affect by trend in treatment 6 a question be whether the decrease mortality
be largely cause by improved treatment 7 8 mammographic screening 9 14 or a combination of the two 15
recommend screen
mammogram
 
although there be no consensus on optimal strategy   target population   or the
harm and benefit 16 screening mammography be the most commonly use
method for the detection of breast cancer in woman of average risk   average risk
be define as the absence of a known susceptibility gene mutation   e g brca1  
brc2    the absence of a history of previous breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in
situ dcis    the absence of a family history of breast cancer   the absence of a history of lobular neoplasia or proliferative lesion on prior biopsy or chest
irradiation 14 17
screen mammography be associate with a decrease in the incidence of
breast cancer by approximately 20   for woman of all age in a 2015 report 14 however   some have express concern for overdiagnosis of breast cancer and risk  
harm base on the timing and frequency of screen mammogram 16 18 22
the american college of obstetrician and gynecologist   acog    the national
comprehensive cancer network   nccn    the american college of radiology
  acr    the american medical association   ama    the american college of surgeon
  acs    and the national cancer institute   nci   recommend annual screening
mammography begin at age 40 year 9 23 24 the acog recommendation be
level b   define as recommendation base on limited or inconsistent scientific
evidence 23
the us preventive service task force   uspstf   recommend  
1   against routine screening mammogram in woman age 40 to 49 year  
   this recommendation be grade c   define as   recommend selective offering or
provide to individual patient base on professional judgement and patient
preference   at least moderate certainty of small net benefit    25 the affordable
care act   aca   leave the discretion to payer regard coverage for a grade c
recommendation   whereas grade a and b be mandate to be cover with no
cost sharing  
2   biennial screening mammography be recommend for woman age 50 74 year
as a grade b recommendation  
   this recommendation be define as a   high certainty that net benefit be moderate
or moderate certainty that net benefit be moderate to substantial   25

3   there be no recommendation for screen after 74 year of age  
   this recommendation be an i grade   define as   conclude that current evidence
be insufficient to assess balance of benefit and harm of the service   evidence be
lack   of poor quality or conflicting and balance of benefit and harm can not
be determine   25 as with the grade c recommendation   the aca leave the
discretion to payer regard coverage 25 26
the american cancer society recommend  
1   regular screening begin at age 45 year with annual mammogram until age
54 year as a strong recommendation  
   this recommendation be define as   most individual should receive the recommend course of action   
2   woman 55 year of age and old be recommend to begin biennial screening
with the opportunity to continue annual screening as a qualified recommendation  
   a qualified recommendation be define as   clinician should acknowledge that
different choice will be appropriate for different patient and that clinician
must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or
her value and preference   
3   woman between the age of 40 and 44 year should have the opportunity to have
annual screening mammogram as a qualified recommendation  
4   there be no age establish to stop mammogram but the recommendation be to
continue as long as there be an overall life expectancy of at least 10 year and
the overall health be good   as a qualified recommendation 27
clinical breast examination   breast self examination   breast self examination
instruction   and breast self awareness
 
clinical breast examination   cbe   be recommend every 1 to 3 year from 20 to 39
year of age and annually begin at age 40 year by acog   level c recommendation   recommendation base primarily on consensus and expert opinion   and
nccn 23 the acs guideline release in 2015 do not recommend cbe for breast
cancer screening among average risk woman at any age as a qualified recommendation 27 29 the uspstf recommendation state that the current evidence be insufficient
to assess the additional benefit and harm of clinical breast examination beyond
screen mammography in woman 40 year of age or old   I statement   30
the recommendation for breast self examination   breast self examination instruction  
and breast self awareness be inter relate and be consider together here   acog have
recommend breast self examination instruction for high risk patient and the nccn
recommend it for all woman   however   for these two group there have be a movement away from this teaching toward breast self awareness as a level c recommendation
from acog 23 the 2003 acs guideline do not include a recommendation for routine
performance of   or instruction in   breast self examination   there be no change in the
2015 guideline 27 the uspstf 2009 guideline recommend against clinician teach
woman how to perform breast self examination as a grade d recommendation 30 define
as moderate to high certainty of no net benefit or that harm outweigh benefit 27 the
uspstf guideline do not address self breast exam or self awareness  
risk and benefit of screen mammogram   breast self examination   breast selfexamination instruction   clinical breast examination   and breast awareness
recommendation
 
the great variation in mammogram screening recommendation be for woman 40 to
49 year old   one study conclude that   if biennial mammography screening start at
 
 
cancer recognition and screen
 
age 40 instead of 50 year   for every 1000 woman screen there would be a median
of 1 more cancer death avert   but 576 more false positive result   67 more benign
biopsy   and 2 additional overdiagnosed case 16 another study conclude that 1 in
every 3400 woman in their 40 screen over 10 year would avoid breast cancer
death compare with those not screen 26 one report find more anxiety   distress  
and breast cancer worry in vary number among woman age 40 to 49 year with
false positive mammography result   another observational study find that of the
woman age 40 to 49 year who experience pain with mammogram   11   to 46  
decline future screen 17 these datum may have contribute to the recommendation
of the uspstf to individualize mammography screen recommendation for
woman age 40 to 49 year with the same recommendation from the acs but for
woman age 40 to 44 year  
one report conclude that mammography screening could possibly identify a nonpalpable mass measure 1 mm to 1 cm during its preclinical phase   consider to be
approximately 3 year before it become palpable 31 it have also be report that the
time from when a cancer can be detect by screen until it become symptomatic
  the sojourn time   vary with age and be the short for woman age 40 to 49 year 23
several study have document that breast tumor grow fast in young   premenopausal woman than in old menopausal and postmenopausal woman 31 32 when
datum from woman screen annually be compare with biannual screening from
age 40 to 85 year   the proportion of tumor that be stage iib or high and large
than 15 mm be great for premenopausal than postmenopausal woman   these
datum may have contribute to the acs recommendation for annual screening mammogram for woman 45 to 54 year old 33 34
other datum show that begin annual mammogram at age 40 year result in
the most life year gained35 37 as well as decrease mortality 14 15 36 a potential
benefit be the identification of woman with high risk lesion   such as atypical ductal
hyperplasia   adh    atypical lobular hyperplasia   flat epithelial atypia   and lobular carcinoma in situ   these woman may benefit from chemopreventive medication to
decrease the risk of develop breast cancer   or screen mri to detect occult
cancer not detect by mammogram   a diagnosis at an early stage with a small
tumor lead to less toxic and well tolerate treatment 24 tumor detect at an
early stage that be confine to the breast be more likely to be treat successfully  
with 98   5 year survival rate 23 one study report that   among woman 40 to 49
year old   those diagnose with breast cancer have an early stage of breast cancer
with small tumor size compare with woman who do not have a screening
mammogram 24 these datum may have contribute to the recommendation by
acog   nccn   acr   ama   and nci to begin annual screening mammogram at
age 40 year  
the other controversial group be woman age 74 year and old   one study
assess comorbidity along with screen to evaluate the potential benefit for this
age group   for woman with no comorbidity   the benefit of screen mammography
extend through age 76 to 78 year   for woman with mild comorbidity   history of
myocardial infarction   mi    acute mi   ulcer or rheumatologic disease   it be 74 to 76
year   for woman with moderate comorbidity   the presence of vascular disease   cardiovascular disease   paralysis or diabetes   it be 72 to 74 year   and for woman with
severe comorbidity   the presence of acquire immunodeficiency syndrome   mild or
severe liver disease   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   chronic renal failure   dementia   or congestive heart failure   it be 66 to 68 year 37 38 these recommendation
be base on a meta analysis that estimate that an average of 10 7 year be
require before 1 death from breast cancer could be prevent per 1000 woman

screen 39 however   healthy patient may choose to continue screen when the
mortality benefit be small but also when less aggressive treatment be need 37 38
in 2002   a large   prospective   randomize trial on breast self examination be publish   there be 26 000 textile worker in shanghai who be either randomize to a
group that be teach breast self examination or a control group that do not receive
the training   after a decade there be no difference in the stage at diagnosis or survival
between the two group   the investigator conclude that breast self examination
be not an effective screening tool 40
some recent report have conclude that there be no direct evidence of an association between cbe alone or in addition to mammography and breast cancer mortality 41 42 however   in area without the availability of screen mammography   some
study conclude that both cbe and breast self examination may be the only
screen available and therefore could be effective in reduce breast cancer
mortality 30 43 44
even though breast self examination be no long teach to woman of average risk
for breast cancer   breast self awareness be recommend by some clinician 10 23 it
have be estimate that more than 70   of breast cancer in woman young than
50 year and approximately 50   of breast cancer in woman old than 50 year
be detect by woman themselves 23 two report conclude that woman should be
encourage to be aware of the normal appearance and feel of their breast and be
encourage to promptly report any change 10 23
risk factor for breast cancer
 
woman at increase risk for breast cancer include woman who be brca1 brca2
mutation carrier   woman with a mother or sister with premenopausal breast cancer  
woman with great than or equal to 20   lifetime risk for breast cancer base on risk
assessment   woman with history of mantle radiation receive between the age of
10 and 30 year   and woman who have biopsy prove lobular neoplasia   adh  
dcis   invasive breast cancer   or ovarian cancer regardless of age 9
risk tool
 
mathematical model exist that stratify risk for breast cancer 10
   the gail model be one of the early model create
 
  it be available at www cancer gov bcrisktool  
   the ibis model include more risk factor than other model
 
  it be available at http    www ems trials org riskevaluator  
web site be available for risk assessment and information on genetic testing for breast cancer  
   the uspstf site be www uspreventiveservicestaskforce org
   the agency for healthcare research and quality web site be www preventiveservice ahrq

genetic
 
acog recommend a genetic risk assessment for woman with a great than 20   to
25   chance of have an inherit predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer   level a
recommendation   recommendation base on good scientific evidence   46
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome include a variety of inherit
cancer susceptibility syndrome   the hallmark of this syndrome be multiple affected
individual in several generation   breast cancer diagnose at an early age   and the
presence of both breast cancer and ovarian cancer in a single individual   strategy
to decrease the risk of breast cancer in these woman may include surveillance   chemoprevention   and surgery 46 recommend surveillance include clinical breast examination semiannually as well as both annual mammography and annual breast mri
begin at age 25 year or soon base on the family history 10
dense breast
 
woman with extremely dense breast have a 4 fold increase risk for breast cancer  
they also have an 18 fold increase risk of interval cancer   define as cancer detect
soon after a normal mammogram base on clinical symptom   these interval cancer
tend to be more aggressive and large and have a bad prognosis than screendetected cancer 47
dense breast tissue on mammogram decrease the sensitivity of screen
mammogram   especially if the cancer lack calcification 48 however   there be no evidence to support additional testing in woman who do not have additional risk factor  
in 2015   an acog committee opinion state that it   do not recommend routine use
of alternative or adjunctive test to screen mammography in woman with dense
breast who be asymptomatic and have no additional risk factor   49
factor affect the relative risk of breast cancer
 
there be an estimate increase relative risk for breast cancer of 1 to 1 5 in woman
who  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
have never have a full term pregnancy
be age 30 year or old at first birth
be current user of hormonal contraception
have menarche at less than 12 year
have late menopause   after age 55 year  
be use estrogen and progestin long term
be obese during postmenopause23 50 51
 
for woman age 40 to 49 year with a great than 2 increase relative risk   some
study recommend screen mammogram before age 50 year 22 50
benign breast disorder
palpable breast mass
 
the evaluation of a breast mass begin with a detailed history   assessment for breast
cancer risk   and physical examination   age appropriate imaging can then be recommend   for woman young than 30 year   with a palpable mass   ultrasonography
be the preferred initial modality   for woman 30 year of age or old with a palpable
mass   diagnostic mammography should be obtain with additional imaging with ultrasonography often require   close clinical follow up   biopsy   or both should be
consider in the case of a discrete palpable mass with negative or discordant imaging result   acog level c recommendation   52
 
263
 
 
264
 
bohon
 
for woman young than 30 year   if the clinical suspicion for malignancy be low  
the mass can be observe for 1 to 2 menstrual cycle with no imaging study   if
the mass resolve   no follow up be need but   if it persist   ultrasonography
be the preferred initial testing 52 one study document a high sensitivity for
ultrasonography compare with mammogram   95 7   vs 60 9    for woman 30 to
39 year old 51 if the ultrasonography detect a simple cyst   no further testing be
necessary   however   if the mass be suspicious   if it be solid on ultrasonography  
or if clinical suspicion be high   a mammogram be the next imaging study
recommend 51 52
for woman 30 year of age and old who have evaluation of a mass with a mammogram that show a definitely benign mass and the clinical suspicion be low   no further
testing be necessary 51 for the remainder of these woman   the next testing be ultrasonography52 with subsequent individualization of care  
one study recommend that woman from 30 to 39 year of age can have either an
ultrasonography scan or a diagnostic mammogram for the initial evaluation of a
palpable mass with the recommendation for diagnostic mammography as the initial
test at age 40 year 51
nipple discharge
 
nipple discharge be the third most common complaint after palpable masse and pain
for woman present to a breast clinic   it be rarely the presenting symptom of cancer 53 benign discharge be multiductal and be more likely to be bilateral   milky   or green
and only present when express   bilateral milky discharge can occur during pregnancy and lactation and persist for up to 1 year postpartum or after the completion
of breastfeed   it can be cause by certain medication or from increase prolactin
level or hypothyroidism 52
discharge that be more suspicious be unilateral   from a single duct   spontaneous  
persistent   and clear   serous   serosanguinous   or bloodstaine 53 if the discharge be
consider to be pathologic   the first imaging study be a sonogram with the possible
addition of a mammogram 52 54 55 if both test be negative   the management be individualize   some patient may proceed to duct exploration and excision   other may
have additional imaging   such as a diagnostic ductography and mri of the breast   the
sensitivity of mammography in these patient be only 15    whereas direct ultrasonography have a sensitivity of 56   55
papillary lesion be common among woman age 30 to 50 year and classically
present with spontaneous nipple discharge   if the lesion be near the nipple it may manifest as a pathologic bloody discharge   intraductal papilloma be benign and 50   be
single lesion   however   there be atypical and malignant lesion with a chance of malignancy range from 3   to14    papillary carcinoma be more common in woman
old than 60 year 53 54
duct ectasia be a benign condition that may cause bilateral viscous nipple discharge
from multiple duct   it be characterize by a dilatation of the mammary duct and usually be manage conservatively 54
breast pain
 
breast pain   mastalgia   be experience by as many as 10   to 30   of woman 56 it be
classify as  
1   cyclic   which have a clear relationship to the menstrual cycle  
2   noncyclic   which can be constant or intermittent and be not associate with the
menstrual cycle   most of these woman be perimenopausal or postmenopausal  
 
 
cancer recognition and screen
 
3   extramammary   which arise from the chest wall or other source   but be consider to be breast pain   most likely it be secondary to costochondritis and other syndrome   include fibromyalgia   cervical radiculopathy   herpe zoster   angina   and
gastroesophageal reflux disease 52 57
cyclic mastalgia can interfere with sleep   physical activity   work or school   social
function   and sexual activity   study include histologic   hormonal   fluid   nutritional   and psychological cause have not show conclusive result 57
likewise   noncyclic mastalgia have an unknown cause and can affect the quality of
life   it tend to be unilateral and localize within a quadrant of the breast   it be think
to be more likely to have an anatomic rather than hormonal cause 57
a common reason for evaluation of breast pain be the fear of cancer   if the only
symptom be breast pain   and there be no risk factor   the risk of cancer be low   a
mammogram and or sonogram should be order base on abnormality note on
physical examination 54 woman with normal finding on clinical examination and a
normal mammographic evaluation for breast pain have an estimate risk of 0 5   for
occult cancer 57
most woman respond to reassurance after normal finding   however   some
require additional intervention   nonpharmacologic measure that be beneficial for some patient include improve mechanical support with counseling
on the use and selection of a properly fitting brassiere   exercise   relaxation
training   and caffeine restriction or elimination 57 evening primrose oil be beneficial for some woman but study show conflicting result   woman with severe
breast pain cause a negative impact on their quality of life be show in some
study to derive benefit from medication such as danazol or tamoxifen   use of
these medication be not frequent because of the concern for adverse side
effect 57
skin change
 
the most common skin disorder of breast evaluate in a dermatology clinic be
melanocytic or nonmelanocytic proliferation   nevi and seborrheic keratosis    cyst  
or reexcision of these lesion   they account for 76   of the biopsy   approximately
4   of the biopsy show metastatic carcinoma   almost all from primary breast
cancer  
most skin disorder of the breast be similar to those find on the abdomen   which
be another sun protect truncal area 58 these diagnosis include psoriasis   eczema  
and contact dermatitis   skin change such as peau d orange   skin edema   and erythema may indicate breast cancer 52
the nipple areolar area have a different set of potential diagnosis   in one study   40  
of the biopsy from the nipple and 60   from the areola represent inflammatory
dermatosis   with most be spongiotic dermatitis or chronic dermatitis   bilateral
involvement of the nipple areolar area favor a benign process  
the dermatitislike paget disease be most commonly unilateral   it can appear as
typical eczema or nipple erosion or ulceration   most woman with paget disease
have a clinical abnormality of the nipple   underlying dcis be detect in more
than 90   of patient with paget disease   it be multifocal in approximately 50   of
the case and do not necessarily occur near or contiguous with the nippleareolar area 58 nipple eczema be a characteristic manifestation of atopic dermatitis  
friction against clothing may cause irritant dermatitis   refer to as jogger s nipple   basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma rarely involve the
nipple 58

inflammatory breast disorder
 
lactational mastitis be the most common form of mastitis   occur in 1   to 24  
of breastfeed woman 53 treatment include antibiotic and encouragement
of milk flow from the engorge area   approximately 5   to 11   of these
woman develop an abscess   which can be confirm with ultrasonography and
manage with aspiration of the fluid or incision and drainage   if inflammation
do not resolve with treatment   imaging study   include sonogram and or
mammogram   may be indicate to assess for associate masse or evidence of
malignancy 54
nonlactational infection be classify accord to location   either central   periareolar   or peripheral   these infection include periductal mastitis   granulomatous
lobular mastitis   and skin associate infection   include infect epidermal cyst
and cellulitis of the breast   tobacco smoking be significantly associate with 90   of
patient who develop periductal mastitis   nipple piercing be associate with a 10  
to 20   risk   other risk factor include diabete   black race   and obesity 53 these infection and abscess be treat similarly to lactate infection and abscess  
recurrent infection be more common than among lactating abscess and may
require surgery   however   as with lactational infection   if the inflammation do not
resolve with treatment   imaging study may be indict to evaluate for evidence of
malignancy 54
inflammatory breast cancer be the most aggressive presentation of breast cancer  
the incidence range from 1   to 5   of breast cancer   in 2010 an international panel
be convene to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of this cancer   minimal
criterion for the diagnosis include  
1   a history of rapid onset of breast erythema   edema and or peau d orange   and or
warm breast   with or without an underlie palpable mass
2   clinical examination reveal erythema occupy at least one third of the breast
3   duration of history of no more than 6 month
4   pathologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma from a core biopsy of the breast59
adolescent
 
adolescent woman commonly have concern about their breast   range from nipple
discharge to pain to appearance 54 when adolescent present for medical examination   the first step be often education and reassurance regard normal variation in
anatomy   growth   and development   they should also be screen for body dysmorphic disorder as recommend in an acog committee opinion 60
palpable breast mass
 
for adolescent with a palpable solid breast mass   sonography be the recommend
test 54 the most common solid breast lesion in adolescent be fibroadenoma  
comprise 86 4   of breast masse in one study involve adolescent 61 the natural
history of fibroadenoma be slow growth and eventual regression   it have be estimate that 16   to 37   resolve within 1 to 3 year and 30   reduce in size within
5 year 61
primary malignant pediatric breast lesion be rare   with a prevalence report as
less than 0 1    the age relate rate for sarcomatous malignant pediatric breast tumor be report as 0 06 per 100 000 adolescent with phyllode tumor as the
most common type   the sonographic finding of benign and malignant phyllode tumor overlap   tissue sampling be need to diagnose the type  
 
 
cancer recognition and screen
 
because of the low risk of malignancy in adolescent and the possibility of a reduction in the size of fibroadenoma over a 2 year period   some clinician have recommend sonographic monitoring of asymptomatic fibroadenoma measure less
than 5 cm and use the combine criterion of size and volume change per month as
an alternative to tissue sample   it have be recommend to continue 6 month
sonographic testing until the resolution of the mass or age 29 year 61
breast asymmetry
 
during puberty it be common to have asymmetric breast growth   if no mass be palpable  
one study advise that patient and their parent can be counsel that asymmetry
often become less noticeable with age 54
juvenile hypertrophy of the breast
 
juvenile hypertrophy be extreme macromastia with pathologic overgrowth of both
breast with the onset of menarche   each breast may weigh as much as 15 to
20 kg   30 50 pound    surgical management be often consider in old teen or
young adult 54
breast reduction surgery
 
breast reduction surgery in adolescent with large breast can relieve back   neck   and
shoulder pain   recommendation for timing of the surgery include postpone surgery
until breast maturity be reach   until there be stability in the cup size over 6 month  
and wait until the age of 18 year   before surgery it be recommend to assess
the adolescent s emotional   physiologic   and physical maturity 60
breast augmentation
 
breast augmentation in adolescent may be perform for reconstruction of congenital deformity or severe asymmetry or as an elective procedure to augment small
breast size or mild asymmetry   the american society of plastic surgeon recommend that woman consider breast augmentation should  
1   be at least 18 year of age before undergo the surgery
2   have the necessary physical and emotional maturity to ensure the most positive
outcome
3   have a realistic understanding of the potential result   as well as the possible need
for additional surgery60

   the obstetrician gynecologist be often the first health care professional who will have an
opportunity to listen   and then evaluate and treat these disorder  
   a wide variety of treatment be available to treat incontinence   include pelvic floor muscle training   behavioral therapy   oral medication   neuromodulation   intradetrusor medication   and surgery  
   when approach the woman with symptomatic prolapse   familiarity with pessary and
various surgical procedure will aid in appropriately counsel the patient  
   referral to a pelvic floor physical therapist or to a female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgeon should be consider   increase attention to datum on cost effectiveness be a
necessity

urinary incontinence
type of urinary incontinence
 
generally   ui be categorize as stress   urge   or mixed incontinence   less common
cause be due to fistula   overflow   or ectopic ureter   we can refer to type of incontinence by symptom   stress ui in which a woman complain of leakage with physical
stress on the bladder   such as cough   sneeze   jumping or lifting   urge incontinence   which be describe as a strong urge to urinate with leakage before become
fully seat on the toilet   or mixed incontinence for woman with both stress ui and
urge incontinence complaint   in the most recent international urogynecology association international continence society consensus document on terminology  
several other category of incontinence symptom have be award official terminology3   table 1    the actual condition may be refer to as urodynamic stress incontinence   in which case that incontinence with cough or a valsalva maneuver have
be diagnose by urodynamic test   detrusor overactivity for case in which uninhibited detrusor contraction have be identify during bladder fill   or urodynamic mixed incontinence   which refer to case when both condition be
diagnose by urodynamic  
evaluation of urinary incontinence
 
initially   patient history be use to determine if symptom be stress   urge   or mix   if
mix   it be pertinent to notate which component occur more frequently or be more
bothersome to the patient  
assessment of the severity of ui may simply involve ask the patient how often
she leak and whether she leak a small or large volume with each episode   use of
pad   the number of pad use   and the type of pad require provide a rough estimate

of the amount of leakage   in general   increase severity of incontinence will be find
as a woman evolve from no pad   to panty liner   to menstrual pad   to incontinence
pad to adult diaper   these product become increasingly bulky and more expensive
along the spectrum   thus   when a woman spend the additional money   she be usually
in need of additional protection from a great volume or frequency of wetness   the
basic difference between menstrual pad and incontinence pad be that the latter
consist of bead make to absorb the less viscous urine   cause the bead to swell
into a gel solid   much like an infant s diaper  
void diary be a low tech method to determine the frequency of incontinence   a
simple voiding diary may be log for 3 to 7 day and consist of have the patient
track when she urinate   and when she leak with a notation as to what be happen
when she leak   such as   cough     zumba class    or   urge    more detailed be the
frequency volume chart   table 2    on the frequency volume chart   the patient log
liquid consume with amount   time of void with volume   any incontinence episode and if and when pad be change   because the frequency volume chart be
quite cumbersome   usually this record be request for 1 to 3 day   provide the patient with a   texas hat   or a urine hat facilitate measure void urine   pad testing be

examine the urethral meatus for evidence of leakage be a critical part of the examination   consider that most woman experience ui with a somewhat full bladder in
an upright position and gynecologist examination typically occur in the dorsolithotomy position after a woman have void   it may be necessary to have the patient stand
and cough to demonstrate stress ui   if the supine empty cough stress test be positive  
however   this be suspicious for severe ui know as intrinsic sphincteric deficiency   in
fact   the negative supine cough stress test have a 70   sensitivity for predict intrinsic

the remainder of the basic assessment involve screen for urinary tract infection

be not cause for alarm   persistently elevate residual deserve further evaluation  
urodynamic testing involve flowmetry or an assessment of voiding function and then

conservative management of urinary incontinence
 
when a woman present with ui   treatment can be initiate before a specific diagnosis
be determine   once we have rule out urinary tract infection   pelvic mass   significant
pop   and elevated residual   then treatment should be offer and may be base on
the predominant symptom   either stress or urge   all woman present for treatment
of ui should be present with option for conservative therapy as well as more invasive option   conservative therapy option include pelvic muscle exercise   alone or
with pelvic floor physical therapy   behavioral therapy   pessary   and medication  
behavioral therapy run a wide gamut of area that can impact bladder function  
these begin with avoid or decrease caffeine intake   assess excess fluid
intake 11 lose weight if the body mass index be great than 30 kg m2 12 and control
of constipation if present   because constipation can negatively impact bladder function   especially urge incontinence   most research support treat constipation to
improve urgency and urge incontinence have be perform in child and the elderly  
but this concept apply to woman of all age 13 14 diabetes be a risk factor for ui   especially type 2 diabetes mellitus   weight loss have be show to improve bladder control
in diabetic 15 16 far   it be very difficult to treat urgency and urge incontinence if significant glycosuria be present   as allude to   perform kegel exercise at home with
only verbal instruction may be poorly effective because the majority of woman with urinary complaint can not contract their pelvic muscle well   a cochrane review
conclude that pelvic floor muscle training should be offer as a first line therapy
for all woman with stress   urge   or mix ui 17 treatment of urge incontinence may
focus on downtraine hypertonic muscle and release of trigger point   rather than
straight muscle strengthen   and be thus another reason that home exercise alone
may not be beneficial   vaginal pessary intend for prolapse control   or those specifically design to control incontinence   can be offer with little risk to the patient  
however   in this evolve atmosphere of cost effective medicine   we need to understand that frequent visit for comfort   a poorly fitting pessary   discharge or spot  
and lack of efficacy can cause the pessary to be fairly expensive   one study find
that at 1 year   both pessary and pelvic floor muscle training be find to be less
cost effective than midurethral sling for the initial treatment of stress ui 18
pharmacologic therapy can be offer to woman with urge or mixed symptom of
ui   increasingly   third party payor require a trial of an anticholinergic medication
before authorization of more invasive procedure   common muscarinic side effect

procedure in urinary incontinence overactive bladder
 
the joint guidelines21 publish in 2014 by the american urologic association   aua  
and the society of urodynamic and female urology recommend allow 8 to
12 week for behavioral therapy and 4 to 8 week for pharmacologic therapy   these
guideline recommend education   behavioral therapy   and then pharmacologic treatment   fourth line treatment for overactive bladder include neuromodulation or intravesical injection of onabotulinumtoxina   botox    there be currently 2 widely
available category of neuromodulation   posterior tibial nerve stimulation   know as
brand name   urgent pc   or implantable sacral neuromodulator   know as sacral nerve
stimulation or by the brand name   interstim  
posterior tibial nerve stimulation be perform in the office set with recommend 12 weekly 30 minute stimulation procedure   the technique involve the placement of a 34 gauge   acupuncture   needle just under the skin 4 to 5 cm cephalad
to the medial malleolus   stimulation via a small handheld device be apply   proper
placement be confirm when movement of the toe   and in particular flexion of the
big toe   occur   the current be increase base on patient tolerability and be set just

posterior tibial nerve stimulation be compare with sham stimulation in a blinded
study of 220 patient with overactive bladder symptom 23 analysis find that 54 5  
experience moderate or marked improvement in overactive bladder compare with
20 9   in the sham group   no serious adverse event have be report in the literature to date   the most common complaint be mild pain at the needle insertion site  
onabotulinumtoxina be indicate for the treatment of refractory idiopathic overactive
bladder or neuropathic overactive bladder   the term neuropathic overactive bladder indicate that there be a know brain   spinal cord   or nerve condition cause detrusor overactivity   the remainder of this discussion refer to idiopathic overactive bladder only  
a systematic review of the use of onabotulinumtoxina in treat refractory idiopathic overactive bladder in man and woman examine the literature publish between 1985 and 2009 24 pool datum determine that onabotulinumtoxina patient
experience about 4 few incontinence episode per day   risk include elevate

ui 27 the burch urethropexy or   burch   involve enter the retropubic space via
open incision or laparoscopy and apply suture to elevate or support the pubovesical tissue to the cooper s ligament along the inner surface of the pubic bone   a pubovesical sling be perform use a vaginal or combined vaginal abdominal approach

pelvic organ prolapse
 
pop refer to the abnormal descent of pelvic organ from their normal attachment
site and into an abnormal position in the pelvis   prolapse can involve  
   the apical compartment   uterine or vaginal vault prolapse   
   the anterior vaginal wall   cystocele   urethrocele    or
   the posterior compartment   rectocele   enterocele   
age   vaginal parity high than 3   and menopause be risk factor associate with
symptomatic pop 33 other factor such as obesity   chronic heavy lifting   constipation  
and genetic be likely contributor   the most common presenting symptom be pressure or bulge 34 overwhelmingly   most woman with symptom present with stage ii
prolapse   further   most woman feel symptom of pop when the lead edge reach
0 5 cm distal to the hymenal ring 35
assessment of pelvic organ prolapse
 
describe prolapse have be a somewhat controversial issue over the past few decade   baden walker describe the half way system that describe the severity of
prolapse   anterior   posterior   apical   on a 4 point grade system   with grade 0 indicate perfect support   grade 1 with lead edge   half way   down the vagina   grade
2 to the introitus   and grade 3 as   half way   through the hymenal ring and grade 4 as
complete prolapse 36 in an attempt to better quantify location of prolapse and degree
for more objective comparison of research outcome   the international continence
society in collaboration with american urogynecologic society and the society of gynecologic surgeon   create the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system or the
pop q   this system use a 9 point measurement system in centimeter include
point along the anterior and posterior vaginal wall   the cervix and or apex   the genital hiatus   and the perineal body 37 although more objective than the half way system  
the measurement be cumbersome and largely a research tool   a compromise system that describe the lead edge in centimeter above or below the hymenal
ring be more clinically applicable   for example   cervix to 13 cm for a uterine prolapse
with the cervix protrude down to 3 cm past the introitus  
conservative treatment of pelvic organ prolapse
 
the general option for treat pop have not change much over the year   all patient should be offer   observation   vaginal pessary   or surgery   pelvic floor physical
therapy be also a consideration and can help to reduce the degree of prolapse and
improve bothersome symptom   a very recent study compare the cost effectiveness
of a vaginal pessary to pelvic floor muscle training in old woman with symptomatic
prolapse   both reduce symptom   yet pessary do so to a great degree   pessary be find to be more cost effective with the important caveat that many
 
279
 
 
280
 
elser
 
woman can not be successfully fit with a pessary and that pessary use result in more
side effect and more office visit 38
young woman who be more active physically and who be sexually active be less
likely to find pessary acceptable   but some definitely will   thus   pessary can be
offer to all woman with symptomatic prolapse   even if surgery be the ultimate
goal   a pessary may provide symptom relief if surgery will not be perform in a timely
fashion   or to help a patient decide how reduction of prolapse will change she
symptom  
the most commonly use pessary in general practice be the ring pessary   the
gellhorn and the donut pessary   choose the proper pessary size be do manually  
similarly to perform a cervical examination on a woman in labor   during digital examination   an estimation of the depth and width with finger spread without cause
patient discomfort   the ring be the easy to remove and replace and   therefore  
prefer first choice if it can be retain   in addition   the ring can remain in place during sexual intercourse   some woman will opt to remove and care for the pessary themselves   whereas other will be unwilling or physically unable to remove a pessary
owe to mobility issue   the gellhorn work through a suction effect and thus may
be effective when a ring pessary can not be retain 39 the donut pessary provide
a space occupy effect that may provide well relief if incomplete bladder empty
be a main symptom   rarely will woman be able to perform self care with any pessary
other than the ring  
although the most recent cochrane review find 1 randomize   control trial
compare 2 type of pessary   the ring and the gellhorn   they conclude that there
be no consensus on good type of pessary or follow up care 40 this lack of datum extend
to use of vaginal estrogen   vaginal antibiotic cream   acidify ointment   how often to
remove and clean a pessary   or when to dispose of a use pessary and replace with a
new device   patient may opt to remove pessary daily   but vaginal ulceration   basically cause by pressure   be manage by pessary removal until the ulcer heal  
topical estrogen may hasten ulcer resolution   how long to trial a pessary or how
many pessary to try be a decision make between clinician and the individual patient  
when a woman who wear a pessary chronically opt to undergo surgery   assessment
of degree of prolapse should be perform when the pessary have be remove and
leave out for a minimum of 3 day because the full extent of the prolapse may not be
readily apparent immediately after pessary removal  
pelvic organ prolapse surgery
 
estimate for the lifetime risk of undergo prolapse repair surgery range from 11   to
19   41 42 of course   many more woman experience symptomatic prolapse than those
who opt for surgical solution   so these number underestimate the incidence of pop  
there be 4 major decision to be make when choose the surgical procedure  
1   vaginal versus abdominal route   open   laparoscopic   or robotically assist   or
some combination thereof  
2   hysterectomy versus uterine preservation  
3   native tissue repair versus mesh augmentation   and
4   concomitant performance of an incontinence procedure  
as far as route of surgery   a 2010 cochrane review examine pop surgery
conclude that abdominal sacrocolpopexy be associate with low rate of recurrence
than vaginal sacrospinous repair   but in exchange for a long operative time   recovery
time   and cost 43 an additional conclusion be that continence procedure at time of
prolapse surgery in dry woman remain controversial  
 
 
manage common urogynecologic disorder
 
traditionally   surgical route and choice of procedure have be base on surgeon
experience and comfort   however   datum drive decision will likely guide decision
in the future   the decision by a gynecologist to perform the prolapse surgery or refer
the patient elsewhere should include consideration of his or her ability to assess each
compartment   anterior   apical   posterior   and perineum   for defect   and the skill to
surgically correct each of these area   as well as resource available in the community  
no strong datum exist to drive decision regard hysterectomy versus uterine preservation   decision making may include surgeon and patient preference   degree of
uterine prolapse   plan for future childbearing   and condition of uterus in term of fibroid   adenomyosis   presence of dysmenorrhea or excessive menstrual bleeding  
postmenopausal bleed   or a markedly elongate cervix  
vaginally place mesh remain controversial   especially in the public eye   but
increase scientific datum support its safety and efficacy when use in the appropriate
patient   the most recent conclusion draw by the sgs systematic review group
be that in the anterior compartment   cystocele repair with mesh augmentation   
both anatomic and symptomatic result be well than native tissue repair   there
be no benefit to biologic graft in any compartment   although mesh erosion or exposure occur in up to 36   of patient   the mesh relate reoperation rate be low
and range from 3   to 8   44 in a recent retrospective review of nearly 5500 surgery
use vaginally place mesh with a mean follow up of 5 4 year   overall reoperation for
mesh relate complication be 4    however   in surgeon who perform more than
14 such surgery per year   the rate be 2   compare with 4 8   for low volume surgeon   the author also find that young age   concomitant hysterectomy   blood
transfusion   and medical comorbiditie also associate with an increase risk of reoperation 45 the american college of obstetrician and gynecologist committee
opinion on vaginally place synthetic mesh state that mesh should be reserve for
high risk individual   describe as those with recurrent prolapse or medical comorbiditie that may add unacceptable risk for open or laparoscopic approach 46 this
committee opinion far recommend that surgeon implant vaginal mesh ought
to have experience with reconstructive surgery and a thorough understanding of the
involve pelvic anatomy  
in term of decide whether to perform a concomitant incontinence procedure at
the time of prolapse surgery   in woman who do not experience bothersome preoperative incontinence remain controversial  
the conclusion reach on the management of urethral support at the time of
abdominal sacrocolpopexy can not be apply to vaginal repair of prolapse   a
cochrane review conclude that incontinence surgery at time of prolapse repair in
dry woman remain controversial 47
summary
 
many woman experience urogynecologic or pelvic floor disorder   especially ui and
pop   the ob gyn be often the first health care professional who will have an opportunity to listen   evaluate   and treat these disorder   a wide variety of treatment be
available to treat incontinence   include pelvic floor muscle training   behavioral therapy   oral medication   neuromodulation   intradetrusor medication   and surgery  
when approach the woman with symptomatic prolapse   familiarity with pessary  
and various surgical procedure will aid in counsel the patient appropriately  
referral to a pelvic floor physical therapist or to a female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgeon should be strongly consider if available and if in the patient s good
interest   increase attention to datum on cost effectiveness be a necessity

key point
   symptom of menopause often begin 4 to 6 year before the cessation of mense and
persist for year  
   loss of ovarian hormone have widespread and often adverse effect on many organ
system  
   therapy for menopausal symptom must be individualize  
 
menopause occur when the ovary have complete   or near complete   follicular
exhaustion   result in very low serum level of estradiol and markedly increase
follicle stimulate hormone   fsh   level   common symptom of menopause
  box 1   often begin during the perimenopausal transition at a median of 47 year or
4 to 6 year before menopause occur   because other medical disorder which occur
frequently with age exhibit some of the same symptom as those of menopause  
woman may have difficulty distinguish when they enter the menopausal transition   this be also true for woman who have have irregular mense   an endometrial ablation or a hysterectomy   symptom continue for several year after menopause and
some woman continue to have vasomotor symptom for even long period of
time   almost all woman with an intact uterus experience menstrual irregularity in the
menopausal transition year result from hormonal fluctuation before ovarian follicular depletion  
the large longitudinal study of woman s endocrine and clinical manifestation of
menopausal transition come from the study of woman s health across the nation
  swan   1 this research evaluate and follow more than 3000 woman from diverse
community   aged 42 to 52 year   for 15 year   scientific area of study for swan
include bone mineral density and body composition   cardiovascular measure and
risk factor   and ovarian marker   ovarian aging be assess by serial assessment

allow recommendation for update criterion and modify the staging system  
although this system be important for research in mature woman s health   it have
applicability also to clinical care in the area of fertility   contraception   and hormonal

menopausal transition   perimenopause  
 
in the early phase of perimenopause   menstrual interval begin to vary by 7 day or
more in consecutive cycle   in addition   there accompany change in fsh level  
which be variable to increase   amh and inhibin b level remain low  
the late phase of menopausal transition occur 1 to 3 year before cessation of
mense and be characterize by increase menstrual interval of more than
60 day   fsh level be increase    25 iu l   with low amh level   antral follicle count

for about 2 year after the final menstrual period   vasomotor symptom be the most
likely   these symptom correspond with persistent increase fsh level   low amh
and inhibin b level   and very low antral follicle count   estradiol level continue to
decrease and fsh level to increase for about 2 year after the final mense   then
for the next 3 to 6 year fsh stabilize and fsh   amh   and inhibin b level be all
very low  
these first 1 to 6 year after the final mense be now term early menopause  
follow these year   vasomotor symptom persist in some woman but be less likely
and symptom of urogenital atrophy be more notable   somatic aging process be
more marked  
the demographic factor of body mass index   bmi    chronologic age   demographic
factor   and lifestyle may influence reproductive aging   however   research use epidemiologic and clinical information show a predictable pattern for most woman   factor
of bmi and smoking may influence the timing of change but not the   trajectory of
change in bleed pattern or hormonal level with reproductive aging   2 this process
do not apply to woman undergo premature ovarian failure   likely because of the
varied cause and possible resumption of mense and ability to conceive  
some other medical condition or a history of endometrial ablation or hysterectomy affect the prediction of transition   woman with amenorrhea from endometrial
ablation   or who have have a hysterectomy   can only be assess by endocrine
marker of ovarian aging   because surgery may result in a transient increase of
fsh level   accurate endocrine level may not be achieve for at least 3 month postoperativley   for a firm diagnosis   a single serum estradiol or fsh result may need to
be repeat 3 4
polycystic ovary syndrome be commonly associate with oligomenorrhea and therefore use of bleed pattern be less reliable when assess reproductive aging   menstrual criterion be also not useful in endocrine disorder with an increase incidence of
amenorrhea   such as hypothalamic amenorrhea   information about the transition to
menopause be need for woman with these disorder   medication   chronic illness  
or loss of significant amount of body fat may also affect menstrual pattern and eliminate the use of bleed pattern to assist in determine menopause  
woman undergo treatment of malignancy may experience month of amenorrhea and symptom of menopause   age at treatment and use of chemotherapeutic
agent may also influence menopausal timing   alkylate agent especially may lead
to transient increase of fsh level and decrease amh and afc but with time

  12 month or more   mense may resume 5 7 resumption of menstrual bleeding may
not indicate normal menstrual function   in woman be treat with tamoxifen  
assessment of menopause may also be difficult   because this medication may alter
fsh and estradiol level and   because of its effect on the endometrium   may cause
abnormal bleeding 8
predict the final menstrual period   fmp   be important for consider bone density
loss and cardiovascular risk   because these risk begin to increase in the year before
the fmp   use of fsh and amh level as well as afc combine with age and other
factor such as bmi be under study to develop a method to more accurately anticipate this event   because ovulatory cycle can occur until 12 month of amenorrhea
have occur   contraception should be a part of any discussion during the menopausal transition  
in addition to the hormonal change describe in the hypothalamic pituitary ovarian
axis   adrenal change during the menopausal transition be associate with increase
in serum cortisol level accompany by transient increase in level of adrenal androgen   androstenediol   dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate   and other    no specific
change in thyroid function relate to menopause have be identify  
after menopause   the great estrogen production be from aromatization of androgen in the ovarian stroma and   to a less extent   from production in extragonadal
site   include adipose tissue   muscle   bone   bone marrow   fibroblast   and hair
root 9 most of the aromatization of androgen to estrogen take place in adipose
tissue  
symptom and physical change of menopause
vasomotor symptom
 
the most well describe symptom of menopause be the hot flash   or hot flush   a vasomotor symptom that occur in up to 80   of woman   these flash may begin during
the late reproductive year but be generally mild and may be associate with mense  
but after the fmp their frequency and intensity increase greatly   nocturnal event be
often describe as night sweat   the most common description of the event be a sudden onset of a feeling of heat in the face or upper chest   which may continue there or
become more generally perceive throughout the body   the duration be often 2 to 4 minute and the feeling be accompany by vary amount of perspiration   additional
symptom include flush of the face   neck   and upper chest   palpitation   and anxiety   it may be follow at time by chill and shiver   they may be particularly disturb at night   disrupt sleep and require change of clothing or bedclothe   the
frequency range from 1 to 2 per day up to 1 or more per hour 10 11 these continue for
more than a year in 80   of woman but commonly abate in 4 to 5 year without treatment   however   up to 9   of woman continue to experience they for many year  
obese woman often report more significant or frequent vasomotor symptom  
although a popular belief be that menopause be associate with weight gain   in reality
weight gain be more associated with aging and lifestyle change  
recently new research have begin to link a history of experience large number of
hot flash to marker of cardiovascular risk   note that some frequent hot flash
may identify a vulnerable vascular phenotype 12
some specific trigger for hot flash include drink hot liquid   move quickly
into an environment with a different temperature   and spicy food   symptom that
significantly disrupt daily life warrant a discussion of therapeutic option   many therapy   medical and nonmedical   have be try with vary result to assist symptom

sleep disturbance
 
woman undergo the menopause transition be at increase risk for loss of quality
sleep   and vasomotor symptom may additionally disrupt sleep   these symptom
may produce chronic insomnia   which   with time   have effect on overall well be  
health   and productivity 13
in addition   common sleep disorder   such as sleep apnea   restless leg   and other
form of insomnia   increase in incidence in woman of menopausal age   depression
also increase in midlife woman and disorder sleep be a common symptom of
depression and anxiety 14
treatment of vasomotor symptom by lifestyle change   supplement   or prescription therapy   as well as therapy for other sleep disorder   relieve these
symptom and improve quality of life   failure to relieve insomnia should lead to
formal sleep study   because pharmacologic sleep medication be for shortterm use only  
headache
 
although the cause of headache be many and tension headache be the most
common headache   hormonally relate migraine headache may increase in the
menopausal transition because of hormonal fluctuation   after menopause  
symptom often decrease again   but migraine headache with aura convey a significant increase risk for stroke   particularly for woman who smoke   migraine headache with aura may show less improvement after menopause than migraine
headache without aura   new onset of headache in woman more than 50 year

the menopausal transition
 
estrogen may slow the rate of decline of memory function 15 16 the woman s health
initiative   whi   do not show a positive effect of estrogen on cognitive function   but
woman with surgical menopause before age 50 year may be prescribe estrogen
to decrease the risk of dementia later in life   estrogen may reduce the risk or delay
the onset of alzheimer disease   although no role for estrogen in the treatment of alzheimer have be show 17 18 in contrast   estrogen therapy initiation after age 65 year
could increase the risk of dementia   because dementia and cognitive decline may be
relate to cardiovascular disease   woman with these concern should be refer for
evaluation of systemic disease  
woman may complain of low mood or mood swing during menopausal transition   new onset depression may occur during the menopausal transition and the
diagnosis occur less often after menopause 19 20 because of the age of woman
commonly go through menopause transition   these chronologic year be
associate with increase incidence of other medical disorder as well as family
and social event   such as becoming so call empty nester and care for age
parent   which contribute potential stressor associate with depressive symptom   although hormone therapy may assist in modification of some of these effect   antidepressant or antianxiety medication along with cognitive behavior
measure and lifestyle modification   sleep   diet   exercise   may provide the good
benefit  
urogenital atrophy
 
estrogen deficiency early in the menopausal transition may be first recognize by
decrease lubrication with arousal and sexual activity   as estrogen level continue
to decrease and as time pass   this effect become more marked   sometimes result not only in dyspareunia but in dryness with normal activity   result in itching and
discomfort   blood flow to the vagina and vulva be reduce   contribute to skin
change   the appearance of the external genitalia reveal less pubic hair and less
elasticity of the vulvar skin with introital narrowing and possible change in architecture   such as loss of the labia minora   vulvar dystrophy   vulvar lesion or dysplasia  
or other dermatologic disorder should be exclude  
chronic hypoestrogenemia produce visual change   include thinner more
glossy tissue appearance   pale pink coloration   and loss of rugae in the vagina  
the elasticity of the vagina lessen and the vagina may become short or narrow  
continue sexual function may decrease these change   even without hormonal therapy   these change commonly develop around 3 year after menopause   although
about 20   of woman report some symptom in the early or late menopause transition 17 the uterus and any fibroid become small and the cervix appear atrophied
and may become flush with the vaginal vault   symptom of endometriosis and
adenomyosis abate   ovarian size decrease and palpation on examination may be
limit  
urinary tract and vaginal ph change with result alteration in bacterial flora may
lead to some itching and malodorous discharge and may contribute to dyspareunia  
the possibility of sexually transmit disease must not be overlook in sexually
active woman with these symptom   vaginal atrophy and associate microabrasion
occur with sexual activity may increase the risk of infection if expose   woman

option for topical administration include vaginal cream or tablet preparation or a
vaginal ring 21 systemic estrogen preparation with or without progesterone provide
excellent vaginal therapy   but may be contraindicate or less desirable to some
woman   also available be a daily oral medication   ospemifene   an estrogen receptor
antagonist with a side chain that be proestrogen in the vulvar and vaginal tissue   it produce mucosal change similar to estrogen preparation which increase tissue thickness and lubrication  
vaginal estrogen may be use in woman undergo therapy for cancer of the
breast   those use tamoxifen   or those who have complete therapy and be experience genitourinary symptom on nonhormonal therapy   less information
regard woman use aromatase inhibitor be available because initiation of vaginal
estrogen initially increase serum estrogen level   but the increase be not maintain
and overall level remain low   although the vaginal ring or tablet may produce the
most consistent dose   cream also provide a very low dose of estrogen to the
vaginal tissue when dose appropriately   few datum be available on cream contain conjugate estrogen than on those contain 17b estradiol 22
the new development in topical therapy for vaginal atrophy be an intravaginal
preparation of 0 5   dehydroepiandrosterone   dhea    a nonestrogen hormone produce by the ovary and adrenal gland that can relieve vaginal dryness and painful intercourse 23 both ospemifene and dhea not only provide symptom relief but   like
estrogen preparation   produce clinically visible improvement in vaginal appearance  
secretion   and thickness   in addition to medical therapy   laser therapy for vaginal
tissue have be available   but result be mixed   and this alternative to medical treatment may result in adhesion and vaginal scarring  
joint and bone change
 
joint discomfort increase with increase age   as do the incidence of rheumatologic disorder   woman who be obese or have depression may have accentuate
symptom   however   there seem to be an association with joint pain and the menopausal transition   these symptom may be relieve by estrogen therapy alone or combination estrogen progestin therapy   as note in the whi 24
osteopenia and osteoporosis be accelerate in development after menopause  
mainly because of accelerated bone resorption   whereas bone formation continue
at premenopausal rate   cortical bone be less affected than trabecular bone   thus
this loss of bone be most pronounce in vertebral   coaxial   and radial site   this rapid
rate of loss in late menopause   and for a few year after   exceed the rate of loss associate with aging and may achieve 20   of lifetime loss 25 lifetime risk of fracture after menopause be also affect by the individual s early bone density   age at
menopause   and other risk factor or medication associate with low bone density  
additional factor include race   smoking status   body habitus   physical activity   serum
androgen   and sun exposure   bone densitometry be the most accurate predictor of

cardiovascular change in menopause
 
cardiovascular disease   cvd   be the lead cause of death in postmenopausal woman  
menopause increase risk for cvd independent of age   result of the whi show that
hormone therapy do not prevent cvd   analysis from the estrogen alone trial suggest that hormone treatment effect differ by age and that young woman versus
their old counterpart have a low risk of cvd   likely associate with less atherosclerotic development   these effect of great safety and decrease incidence of disease
also apply to overall mortality   colorectal cancer   and global index of disease 26 the
benefit of estrogen on cardiovascular mortality be likely multifactorial   estrogenrelate reduction of low density lipoprotein level and increase of high density lipoprotein level   and improve endothelial function in coronary vasculature 27
breast cancer and menopause
 
the relationship of estrogen to postmenopausal development of breast cancer be
controversial and study result regard causation be mix   in the whi study   the
incidence of breast cancer increase in the estrogen progestin arm of the study and
decrease in the estrogen only and placebo arm   these finding continue in the
follow up study of this population   the slightly increase relative risk of breast cancer
could have be relate to the length of hormone use or the sequential administration of
the progestin therapy or even the progestin formulation itself   in contrast   hormone therapy user have more localize tumor and improve survival rate   individual risk be
very small  
breast cancer survivor with menopausal symptom and vulvovaginal atrophy have
few choice of therapy because systemic therapy be not advise for hormonedependent tumor   option for symptom management include nonhormonal moisturizer   vaginal estrogen   androgen   selective estrogen receptor modulator   serm   
laser therapy   or nonprescription intervention such as acupuncture   dietary supplement   and lifestyle change   woman use tamoxifen should not use paroxetine for
vasomotor symptom   serm may also increase the risk of thrombosis and should
be avoid in woman with a high risk of thrombosis  
venous thromboembolism
 
the risk of thromboembolism increase with increase age combine with medical
comorbiditie   venous thromboembolism   vte   be a multifactorial disease with risk
increase by decrease mobilization   surgery   malignancy   and medication

although the risk of vte associate with hormonal combine contraceptive use have
be widely discuss   the use of menopausal hormonal therapy also increase the
risk for vte   current use of estrogen preparation alone and estrogen progestin
combination medical regimen increase the risk of vte 2 fold or 3 fold   with oral
combine estrogen progestin regimen confer a high risk than estrogen alone  
transdermal preparation of estrogen or estrogen and progestin combine medication and vaginal estrogen preparation seem not to increase the vte risk 28
north american menopause society recommendation
 
in 2014   the north american menopause society   nam   release recommendation
concern the clinical care of midlife woman   this publication provide an overview of
menopause and the physiologic change follow by a succinct discussion of symptom of menopausal transition and clinical recommendation for care   many of the
recommendation be discuss early in this article 29 additional area discuss
in the nam publication include  
skin and hair
 
decrease skin thickness and collagen result in more skin laxity and wrinkling   with
symptom exacerbate by sun and environmental factor and smoke   many woman
experience hair loss after complete the menopause transition   whereas other note
hirsutism   test for woman with hair loss include thyroid function   serum iron   and
exclude androgen excess   loss of ovarian estrogen production result in a relative
androgen excess environment   which may also be influence by genetic factor and a
history of androgen excess   therapeutic approach that block peripheral androgen
combine with pharmacologic medication or aesthetic procedure for removal of unwanted hair provide the good approach   more study be need to strengthen the level
of recommendation for manage these problem  
eye
 
menopause be associate with increase symptom of dry eye and cataract development   the initial therapy for dry eye be topical lubricant and antiinflammatory
agent  
ear
 
the incidence of hear loss increase beyond age 50 year   the cause of hear
loss be multifactorial but it may increase social withdrawal and depression   physiologic
level of estrogen may assist with hear preservation but estrogen progestin combination therapy may have a small negative effect  
tooth and oral cavity
 
loss of estrogen be associate with thinning and recession of gingival tissue   in addition   low bone mineral density may lead to an increase risk of tooth loss and periodontal disease  
gallbladder disease
 
an increase risk of gallbladder disease have be show with both estrogen therapy
alone and estrogen progestin combination therapy   the risk of disease seem great
with oral versus transdermal hormone therapy and all systemic hormone therapy
should be prescribe with caution to woman with know gallbladder disease  
 
 
the menopausal transition
 
epilepsy
 
menopause may occur early in woman with epilepsy   the cause could be associate
with the number of lifetime seizure or with seizure medication   particularly those metabolize by the hepatic cytochrome p 450 enzyme   which also affect estrogen metabolism
and level   many woman have hormonally sensitive seizure and   during the hormonal
fluctuation of the menopause transition   may have an increase number of seizure  
pharmacologic approach suggest for management include natural progestin supplementation or menstrual suppression with depomedroxyprogesterone acetate or
gonadotropin release hormone agonist   in addition   the antiepileptic medication
gabapentin may assist with vasomotor symptom   whereas other seizure medication
may accelerate vitamin d metabolism   possibly increase risk for osteopenia  
the nam document also provide recommendation for clinical history   screen
for malignancy   as well as clinical evaluation and counseling patient   both summary of prescription and nonprescription therapy in menopause and for menopausal symptom be review 29
perhaps the most important concept in the care of woman in the menopausal transition be individual assessment of risk   clinical need   and symptom relief for the present and for future health and well be

the problem be pervasive
all physician be at risk
 
professional burnout be not new what be new be the wide recognition of the alarming
rate of burnout 4 5 physician   in general   have burnout rate that be twice the rate of
work adult   and no area of practice within medicine be immune to the impact of
professional burnout   see fig   1   1 6 a 2015 survey of plastic surgeons7 find that
nearly one third   29    of those survey score high in subscale category predictive of professional burnout   consistent with other national survey 8 in a sample of
127 headache medicine specialist   66   57 4    physician report symptom of professional burnout reflect by high emotional exhaustion or high depersonalization 9
a 2015   meta analysis of burnout in emergency physician find moderate to high
level of burnout with difficult work condition include significant psychological demand   lack of resource   and poor support 10 consistent with old study that find
rate of burnout in excess of 60   11 nonetheless   these physician report high job
satisfaction   many pediatric emergency physician report feeling burn out at work
  88 5    or more callous toward people as a result of work   67 5    at least monthly  
with 1 in 5 report such feeling at least weekly 12 pediatric intensivist have burnout
rate of almost 80    and a reference group of general pediatrician have an almost
30   rate of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization   this rate be low for professional accomplishment 13
in a study of us surgeon   40   of those respond be burn out   30  
screen positive for symptom of depression   and 28   have a mental quality of life
score great than 1 2 standard deviation below the population norm 14 almost
50   of anesthesiologist score positive for burnout domain in different survey  
 
 
burnout in obstetrician and gynecologist
 
with one third report high level 15 in a 2015 study of us neurosurgeon   the overall
burnout rate be 56 7    and 30   of those survey would not choose a career in
neurosurgery again 16
physician burnout be not restrict to the united states   in a 2016 study to determine
the incidence of burnout among uk and irish urologic consultant and nonconsultant
hospital doctor   high level of burnout be find   characterize by emotional
exhaustion and depersonalization 17 these be associate with significant level of
self medication   and 60   report that they would take advantage of counseling if
offer   in a cross sectional study of austrian physician   10 3   be affect by major depression   and more than 50   of the participant be affect by symptom of
burnout 18 among australian and new zealand radiation oncologist   nearly half of the
respondent score highly in at least 1 burnout subscale 19
the prevalence in obstetrician and gynecologist
 
a recent survey of gynecologic oncologists20 find that 30   of study subject
score high for emotional exhaustion   10   high for depersonalization   and 11  
low for personal accomplishment all marker for burnout   overall   almost onethird   32    of the physician study have score indicate burnout   more concern
be that 33   screen positive for depression   13   have a history of suicidal ideation   15   screen positive for alcohol abuse   and 34   report impaired quality of
life   almost 40   would not encourage their child to enter medicine   and more
than 10   say that they would not choose medicine as a career again if they have
to do it over  
although burnout in subspecialist in obstetric and gynecology have be well
document 20 21 less well understand be the difference   if any   between those who
practice the full scope of obstetric and gynecology and those who subspecialize  
weinstein 22 writing in this journal   speculate that practice pattern such as   laborist  
may result in few stress of a private practice   with a more predictable and controllable schedule   although a reduction in burnout rate be unreporte  
resident and young physician be at increase risk
 
although professional burnout can occur at any point in a physician s career   young
clinician be at particular risk   with resident and those at midcareer particularly
vulnerable 23 resident burnout rate be report as high as 75   3 24 in a 2012 study  
of the survey resident   13   satisfy all 3 subscale score for high burnout and
great than 50   have high level of depersonalization and emotional exhaustion 25
those with high level of emotional exhaustion be less satisfied with their career  
regret choose obstetric and gynecology   and have high rate of depression  
all consistent with old study 26 27
a study of australian trainee find a total incidence of burnout of 55 9    with
the high rate in the first year of training 28 and among orthopedic trainee   53  
be consider burn out 29 in another study of 204 doctor undergo
residency training in multiple specialty in a tertiary hospital   45 6   of respondent report burnout in the dimension of emotional exhaustion   57 8   in the
dimension of depersonalization   and 61 8   in the dimension of reduce personal
accomplishment 30 the impact of burnout for early to midcareer practitioner be
less well study   but base on the small difference find in study across student   resident   and early career physician by dyrbye and colleague 31 it be
reasonable to assume that burnout continue to be at least as prevalent in these

identify the cause
 
in medicine and other profession   the likelihood of burnout happen depend on
personal   developmental psychodynamic   professional   and environmental factor  
but the exact role of each in the development of burnout be incompletely understand 32
the very same attribute that make successful physician   eg   type a behavior  
obsessive compulsive commitment to the profession   increase the risk for professional burnout   in general   autonomy   the power to make decision   the workload  
and working hour seem to be the great driver of emotional exhaustion   the strong predictor of burnout 33
positive depression screen   pathologic sleepiness   and sleep less than
7 hour a night be independent predictor of burnout in a study of medical student
publish in 2016 34 in other study   a high level of depersonalization have be
inversely correlate to job satisfaction and personal accomplishment and strongly
correlate to depression both risk factor for burnout 25 a high level of personal
accomplishment have be strongly correlate with job satisfaction and satisfaction
with obstetric and gynecology as a specialty but be inversely correlate with a
sense of depersonalization   no correlation between burnout and self care activity
be find   similarly   young age and great job dissatisfaction have be find
to predict high depersonalization   low coworker support and great job dissatisfaction predict low personal accomplishment 35
unlike early study   a 2016 study find that woman be at great risk of professional burnout than their male counterpart 36 this gender difference may be drive by
unrealistic expectation   family pressure   work life imbalance   or sleep disorder  
sleep disorder be prevalent among physician   especially among woman   in
whom rate be between 35   and 40   37 38 the importance of sleep disorder have
be emphasize in many study   which show that change work schedule   night
shift   and the consecutive fragmented sleep could have a severe cognitive and
emotional impact on the performance of physician on the day after a shift   independent of gender   the issue of work life balance have be the subject of great debate and
study show the difficulty of balance between work and family as important determinant of burnout 39 40
the issue of gender would seem to be of particular interest in obstetric and gynecology   in which now more than 50   of practitioner be woman   despite this obvious
need   and the fact that stress reaction and gender have even be study even
among woman professional golfer 41 report of study of this aspect of the specialty
be conspicuously lack in the literature  
workload   a sense of control over one s work environment   and a share core
mission or vision   alignment of core value   be the large driver of burnout in a
study of practice primary care physician 42 similarly   a study of transplant surgeon
find that unsupportive environment with little decisional control and high workrelated demand contribute to the development of burnout 43
in general   have some control over schedule and hour work be associate with
reduction in burnout and improved job satisfaction 44 professional autonomy  
decision make support and supervision for trainee   and social support have be
find to reduce burnout in training program 45 but physician in academic setting
tend to have high rate of burnout 46 this may not be surprising because the academic environment be more bureaucratic   give the individual less control    often
less efficient   and less able to deal with business matter   despite this finding   have
more control and a reduce workload be not always protective   well intentione effort to reduce workload   such as the electronic medical record or physician order
 
 
burnout in obstetrician and gynecologist
 
entry system   have actually make the problem bad 47 even the seeming level of
control that come with be the chairman of a department of obstetric and gynecology do not reduce burnout rates48 nor do the resilience of mental health professional   who one might expect to be able to thwart the threat   who still report
burnout rate that approach 25   49
stress versus burnout
 
stress be often see as the primary cause of burnout   but there be no single cause of
burnout 8 23 rather   several factor combine to cause the physical or mental collapse
that be burnout   stress can be a positive or negative factor in our performance   too little stress lead to feel underutilize and too much stress lead to collapse from the
strain   but there be a middle ground at which stress and expectation maintain focus
and peak productivity deadline create focus   expectation provide standard to
shoot for   and so on   the key be the balance between control and demand   when there
be a great level of control   high demand can be handle   when there be a lack of that
control   high demand result in what have be call toxic stress   and collapse be likely
to occur  
physically   stress induce the dry mouth   dilate pupil   and the release of adrenalin
and noradrenalin associate with the   fight or flight   reaction   psychosocial stress influence cognitive ability   such as long term memory retrieval   and have strong
impair effect on cognitive flexibility in man more than woman 50 in one study  
former patient with prolong work relate stress improve with professional care  
but they continue to perform bad than control after 1 year 51 in the acute phase  
the large impairment be relate to executive function and mental speed   but at
follow up   memory impairment also become apparent  
burnout   as oppose to stress   be characterize by exhaustion   lack of enthusiasm
and motivation   and feeling of ineffectiveness   with the add dimension of frustration or cynicism   result in disengagement   demotivation   and reduce workplace
efficacy   table 1    although chronic stress be identify as one of the key factor   as
note above   no one element be sufficient to exceed the adaptive ability of the individual   burnout be generally more gradual   progressive   and insidious than stress   make it more likely to go undetected until far along its continuum  
peril of burnout
 
physician burnout be associate with reduce productivity52 and threaten work life
balance among physician   especially those in dual career relationship 1 39 among
emergency physician   burnout be significantly associate with high frequency
of self report suboptimal care53 and strongly associate with actual reduction in
professional work effort over the follow 24 month 53 condition in which there
be weak retention rate   high turnover   heavy workload   low staffing level   or staffing shortage increase the risk of burnout and   when burnout be present   be associate with a degraded quality of the care provide 54 burnout be also associate with
an increase risk for physical illness 55
economically   the impact of physician burnout   for physician practice in canada  
be estimate to be   213 1 million 56 this sum include   185 2 million from early retirement and   27 9 million from reduce clinical hour   in a study of 353 genetic counselor   more than 40   have either consider leave or leave their job role because of
burnout 57 among residency program director in radiation oncology survey   11  
of respondent meet criterion for low burnout   83   for moderate burnout   and 6   for
high burnout   although 78   of respondent report feel   satisfied   or   highly

when advanced   burnout be associate with depression and an increase risk of suicidal ideation   suicidal ideation have be find to be more prevalent among physician than in the general population 59 60 in a meta analysis   suicide be almost one
and a half time more frequent among male physician compare with the general
population and twice as likely for female doctor 61
the impact of burnout go beyond the emotional   obstetrician must be sensitive
to the fact that burnout   whether in patient or female colleague   be predictor of
infertility   miscarriage   and high risk pregnancy   in a recent study of female hungarian physician with burnout   there be more complication of pregnancy   although a
 
 
burnout in obstetrician and gynecologist
 
clear causal relationship can not be established62 despite old study that find a
link between job stress   preterm delivery   and low birth weight for gestational age 63
clearly   difficulty achieve   carry   or deliver a healthy pregnancy themselves
be source of significant stress that could precipitate emotional collapse and
burnout for the family involve   there be a great deal of overlap between burnout
and other pathologic condition such as depression 18 make distinction between
they difficult  
be I burn out  
 
fatigue and stress be ubiquitous   but that be not the same as burnout   the degree to
which the physical   emotional   and professional symptom be manifest depend on
the depth or stage of burnout present   see table 1    make diagnosis problematic  
the effective gold standard for diagnose burnout be the maslach burnout inventory
  mbi   64 the mbi operationalize burnout as a 3 dimensional syndrome make up of
exhaustion   cynicism   and inefficacy   the mbi comprise 3 scale  
1   emotional exhaustion   9 item    a state of chronic emotional and physical depletion
2   depersonalization   5 item    a sense of disconnection from coworker and client
3   diminish personal accomplishment   8 item    a negative sense of self value and
ability
other diagnostic tool have be introduced65 but have not gain the wide acceptance of the mbi   for example   west and colleagues66 validate single item from the
mbi emotional exhaustion and mbi depersonalization subscale as standalone measure   and this approach have be validate by other 67 some investigator have
argue that burnout and depression represent different   closely space   point along
a spectrum and that any effort to separate they may be artificial 68 69
unfortunately   the mbi require a fee   consist of 22 item   and require interpretation by a qualified individual   a simple screening test than the complete mbi consist
of 10 screening question   box 1    if the individual can answer   yes   to 5 or more   they
probably have burnout   for most individual   a simple review of the symptom and
finding find in table 1 and box 1 will give a reasonable appraisal of the likelihood
of burnout   this approach would seem reasonable for simple self assessment or for
broad screening of patient   friend   or family  
box 1
burnout screen question
1   do you find a lack of pleasure in other activity   anhedonia   
2   do you manifest cynicism  
3   be your work affect family  
4   do you dread go to work  
5   be you easily annoy  
6   do you envy those who be happy  
7   do you no long care about performance  
8   do you have fatigue low energy  
9   be you bore  
10   be you depressed before the work week

psychologist herbert freudenberger and gail north   study burnout in woman  
theorize that the burnout process can be divide into 12 phase 70 this division
have limit utility because the phase be not necessarily follow sequentially  
some may be absent   and other may present simultaneously and broadly mimic
the symptom and progression see in the more general description of characteristic   such as show in table 1   it be easy to see how a progression of symptom can
represent a potentially spiral series of behavior and change that result in complete dysfunction   it be also easy to understand that the characteristic associate
with success in medical school   training   and practice   such as high expectation  
place the need of other above our own   and a desire to prove oneself   virtually
define the first 3 of these stage  
prevention
 
because the early symptom and sign of professional burnout be both common and
insidious   prevention and early intervention be always reasonable   fortunately   there
be some simple step that can be take to reduce the risk of burnout or to reverse its
effect   because stress and fatigue be 2 of the great risk factor for burnout  
reduce these be a good place to start   when it come to fatigue   the solution be
easy   sleep   physician tend to sleep few hour than those in the general population
and what be achieve be often not the type that be restful and restorative 71 just
reduce the number of hour work be not enough   as several study have find 72
the rest must result in relaxation and renewal  
the impact of reduce duty hour might be anticipate to reduce both the fatigue and
stress of resident training and   thus   the risk of burnout   in at least 1 study   this have not
be the case   in a study of internal medicine resident   year end burnout prevalence
and incidence of burnout do not differ significantly between those before and after the
imposition of new work hour restriction 73 interestingly   there be no difference in
year end prevalence of excessive sleepiness   as measure with the epworth scale  
among these same learner   another study have find that organization may be able
to improve burnout   dissatisfaction   and retention by address communication and
workflow and initiate quality improvement project target clinician concern 74
stress reduction may seem more difficult than get more sleep   although study
indicate that experience or habituation to stressful situation can blunt the impact of
stress 75 this should not be see as an adaptive way of deal with stressful situation   in reality   there be several simple approach that can be use to reduce stress  
alter it   direct communication   problem solve   time management    avoid it   delegate  
know limit   walk away    or accept it   build resistance   change perception    even
though clinician all have busy clinical schedule   take short break to rest   sing  
laugh   or exercise can go a long way to reduce stress   shanafelt and colleagues76
  who have contribute frequently to the burnout literature   find that even break
as short as 10 minute can be effective  
separate work from private life by take a short break to resolve issue before
head home avoid   baggage   or homework will go a long way to give
perspective from time off   this may also mean that task have to be delegate   share
chore or get carry out for dinner   set meaningful   and realistic goal professionally
and personally   don t expect or demand more than be possible   this will mean set
priority some task may have to wait   finally   don t forget hobby and activity
that be enjoyable  
physical activity have be show to reduce feeling of fatigue and provide an
improve sense of wellbeing   but this effect appear blunt in the face of chronic

when symptom of burnout present   one can reduce the effect   deal with the source   and improve attitude   box 2    rest and relaxation will go a long way to help  
but so will physical wellbee   a healthy diet   exercise   and health checkup   deal
with the source of burnout by identify the stressor   set realistic priority   and
time management can also be helpful   individual should also lobby for change that
will increase their control and reduce unnecessary obstacle to complete goal  
look for the good and try to identify at least one instance during the day in which
your presence or act make a difference  
take advantage of mentor   friend   and love one to provide perspective   balance   and succor   because depression and burnout may be virtually indistinguishable 68 69 seek professional help and counsel early   this help can be in the form
of train counselor   mentor   clergy   or other   these helper must be able to
respect the individual s privacy and trust but also bring either training or perspective  
they can help improve self awareness and develop cope strategy that be protective   do not attempt to   go it alone   or self medicate with antidepressant   alcohol   or
other substance they will only compound the problem 79
in the end   obstetrician and gynecologist really do have the tool to reduce   mitigate   or avoid the threat of professional burnout   just as with the push to include patient satisfaction with any measure of the quality of the medical care we provide   the
quality of our own life must matter   with self awareness   utilization of cope mechanism   and reliance on strong social and professional support network   burnout can
be combat  
summary
 
the fast pace of life   the impact of multitaske and the unending bombardment of information have make emotional exhaustion almost certain   study indicate burnout

diagnosis and intervention   successful intervention can range from hobby and vacation to skilled counseling   whatever the route take   no physician should feel immune   no physician should feel ashamed or alone   and no physician should feel that

long act reversible contraception   larc    and permanent sterilization  
natural family planning

barrier method
 
most barrier method be use by female partner   include diaphragm   contraceptive sponge   cervical cap   and female condom   male partner   latex condom can
help decrease the risk of sexually transmit disease   stds   in addition to a contraceptive benefit   barrier method have the add benefit of not be contraindicate

cervical cap
 
like the sponge   there be only one type of cervical cap available in the united states  
the femcap silicone device   femcap   inc   del mar   can   11 like the diaphragm   the
cervical cap require both a clinician s size the device and a prescription   fig   3

to these effect by combination ocp   the progestin component alter both the endometrial lining and cervical mucus result in less favorable condition for implantation
and fertilization

the large prospective cohort contraceptive choice project reveal that woman
young than 21 year who use short acting contraception be almost twice as

be potentially especially beneficial in this population   condom should be recommend as well for their role in the prevention of sexually transmit infection  
obese patient may potentially benefit from hormonal method   and they should be

key point
   vaginal complaint such as discharge   odor   irritation   and itching be a very common
reason woman seek the help of a health care provider  
   most patient be correctly diagnose and treat   but some go on to have no resolution
of symptom with treatment or rapidly recur symptom  
   vulvovaginal candidiasis   bacterial vaginosis   and trichomoniasis be the most common
vaginitide   uncomplicated case be easy to treat and have very successful outcome  
   patient with chronic or recurrent vaginal complaint need an accurate diagnosis and
other   rare   condition need to be rule out  
   once the correct diagnosis be make   effective therapeutic option for cure and symptom
control can be implement  
 
background
 
vaginal symptom be one of the most common reason woman seek care with a
health care provider 1 woman can experience a decrease in their quality of life from
discomfort and pain   absence from work or school   disturbance in sexual function  
anxiety   and a change in their self image   after treatment   most of these symptom
resolve without any further issue   but some woman do not get well with therapy  
recur frequently   or never receive a correct diagnosis after initial therapy fail 2
the term   vaginitis   be a general diagnosis that include a wide array of condition in
every age group   of these   uncomplicated bacterial vaginosis   bv    vulvovaginal
candidiasis   and trichomoniasis be diagnose in 70   of patient 3 of those   40  
to 50   have bv   20   to 25   have vaginal candidiasis   and 15   to 20   have trichomoniasis 4 the remain 30   be undiagnosed and   among other   can have physiologic discharge   leukorrhea    atrophic vaginitis   vulvar dermatologic abnormality  
or vulvodynia 3 5
although uncomplicated   acute   single episode of vaginitis may be quite simple

see many different health care provider with multiple attempt therapeutic
agent 2 patient be often frustrated and present a therapeutic challenge for health
care provider   give the decrease in quality of life create by these symptom   a
methodical evaluation with consideration of a broad differential diagnosis be
necessary 2
diagnose   other than the common vaginitide   that present as vaginal complaint
include physiologic discharge   desquamative inflammatory vaginitis   div    cytolytic
vaginosis   chronic vulvar disease   atrophic vaginitis   localize provoke vestibulodynia   contact dermatitis   erosive lichen planus   or other unusual condition   multiple diagnosis can quickly complicate evaluation and management 2 6 thus   the art of
history taking and physical examination be a must for appropriate diagnosis   however  
clinical evaluation alone have be show to be insufficient for the diagnosis of
vaginitis 2 7
the vaginal ecosystem
 
a delicate equilibrium   the vaginal ecosystem consist of a variety of bacteria and
metabolic product from the microbe and the host   acid   carbohydrate   protein  
and nucleic acid   fatty acid   and sugar from degrading bacteria be present 8 there
be nonpathogenic and pathogenic microbial specie that exist in a ratio of approximately 200 1   table 1   8 under the right condition   nonpathogenic bacteria can cause

vaginitis   beyond the basic
 
symptom   disruption or imbalance of the ecosystem result in dominance of
nonpathogenic and pathogenic bacteria over lactobacillus and increase risk for
bv or bacterial vaginitis 9 it can be difficult to determine the cause of infection because
gram positive and   negative   as well as aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be find
in a healthy vagina 9 pathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas spp    staphylococcus
aureus   escherichia coli   enterobacter spp    and haemophilus influenzae have be
isolate from asymptomatic   healthy woman 9 colonization with pathogenic bacteria
have be associate with adverse outcome of pregnancy   such as chorioamnionitis
and endometritis 9 infectious complication from gynecologic procedure be more
likely if the vaginal ecosystem be disrupt   so much so that screen patient preoperatively for abnormality on wet preparation have be suggest 9
specific lactobacillus specie be responsible for maintain the healthy vagina
  see table 1   9 typically only 1 specie exist   which inhibit pathogenic bacteria in
3 ways10 11  
1   production of organic acid   specifically lactic acid    which maintain a ph between
3 8 and 4 2  
2   secretion of hydrogen peroxide   and
3   lactocin production  
not all lactobacillus specie can perform this duty if they can not secrete significant
amount of the require element 12 although lactobacillus grow good in a ph great
than 4 5   it can grow in a low ph between 3 8 and 4 5   whereas other bacterial inhabitant of the vagina either do not grow at a ph below 4 0   or grow poorly at a ph of
4 0 to 4 5 13
the role of estrogen
 
the lack of estrogen in the prepubertal and postmenopausal states result in a thin
vaginal epithelium with a high ph    4 7    the ecosystem before puberty contain a
different variety of organism from that which be fully estrogenize   and include
skin and fecal flora 2 colonization of lactobacilli be encourage by estrogen stimulation of glycogen with subsequent decrease in ph to less than 4 7 5 addition of estrogen cause an increase in vaginal discharge   which often lead to the conclusion that
the patient have vulvovaginal candidiasis   despite objective evidence on physical examination and office base laboratory testing to the contrary   this misinterpretation
can result in inappropriate diagnosis and treatment 2 in the postmenopausal patient  
atrophic vaginitis may be the cause of discharge   particularly in the setting of vaginal
dryness   dyspareunia   and irritation  
evaluation of vaginal complaint
history and physical examination
 
history and physical examination be vital to the proper diagnosis of vaginal symptom   patient history should include the characteristic of the discharge such as color  
consistency   and amount 3 severity   duration   and recurrence of symptom should be
elicit   along with use of any product that contact the vulva and vagina   a sexual
history should include a history of and risk factor for sexually transmit infection

note   cervical friability   tenderness of the cervix   pain with palpation of the uterus   or

laboratory testing
 
sample should be take at the time of examination with the specific test determine
by the clinical scenario   for all patient   a sample of the discharge should be collect
from that pick up on the speculum or use a swab in the posterior vagina for saline
and   koh   preparation   a sample for ph should be take from the mid vagina 5 sample for bacterial culture   fungal culture   and nucleic acid amplification test for gonorrhea   chlamydia   and trichomonas should be consider 2
the saline and 10   koh wet prep be the main test use for diagnosis of vaginitis   there be multiple way to prepare the slide   but the most common be to place
some discharge on a glass slide and add a drop of saline   likewise   the same process
be repeat with a drop of 10   koh   because yeast be more commonly see on the
koh slide 3 the fishy   amine   odor of bv can be note by perform a   whiff   test of
the 10   koh preparation   coverslip be apply and a general inspection of the slide
be perform on low power   100     a power of 400   be the standard magnification
use to evaluate vaginal sample and should be use for diagnosis 3 although an
important test for office evaluation   the saline and koh prep have some limitation
in term of sensitivity   specificity   and likelihood of disease give a positive or negative
test 3
finding like trichomonad   clue cell   yeast pseudohyphae or bud   presence or
absence of lactobacilli   and presence of leukocyte be evaluate on the saline wet
preparation   white blood cell on saline microscopy be nonspecific and can indicate
trichomoniasis   vaginal candidiasis   atrophic vaginitis   bacterial vaginitis   cervicitis   or
upper genital tract infection   along with history and physical examination   these officebased test be adequate to diagnose most patient with vaginal complaint   however   additional   more complex testing may be need in some case  
physiologic discharge
 
discharge find within a normal vagina come from several origin   mucus be produce by the periurethral   skene s   and bartholin gland   and the cervix   because
there be no mucosal cell in the vagina   the discharge be a transudate secrete
through the vaginal epithelium and from the cervix   physiologic discharge   also
know as leukorrhea   be therefore a culmination of fluid   cell   and cellular debris  
a normal woman of reproductive age not on hormone therapy will produce approximately 1 to 3 g of vaginal discharge per day 9 hormonal modification of vaginal
discharge can be misinterpret as infection   with clear discharge at ovulation and
thick   white discharge during other phase of the cycle   this misperception be common   and in a tertiary care program   9   of refer patient with chronic vulvovaginal complaint be diagnose with physiologic discharge 14 characteristic of
physiologic vaginal discharge and common vaginitide be list in table 4   result
of office base testing be list in table 5   urinary incontinence can be exclude by
give phenazopyridine for 1 to 2 day and look for a change in color of the vaginal
discharge 2
the value of in office measurement of ph can not be emphasize enough   but it be
frequently underuse   the american college of obstetrician and gynecologist
and the center for disease control and prevention stress its importance and have
incorporate it in their guideline for evaluation 5 7 the result of ph testing can drive
the entire diagnostic process by reduce the number of potential diagnose 2 limitation of ph testing can occur when there be contamination of the speciman   gel use to
lubricate the speculum may alter measurement of ph   likewise   douche   semen   and
intravaginal medication can also alter ph measurement 3 5

vulvovaginal candidiasis
 
about 75   of all woman will develop a symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis at least
once in their life   one half of all woman will have sporadic recurrence   with about
8   have at least 4 episode every year   chronic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis   15 over the counter antifungal medication be in the top 10 of all over thecounter medication sell in the united states 16 and more than   1 8 billion be spend
in 1995 on medical treatment   time off   and travel expense because of candida vaginitis   with an extrapolate estimate of   3 1 billion in 2014 15
requirement for a symptomatic infection include colonization with a candida specie   this colonization occur by local transport from the perineum and perianal area  
by digital introduction or sexual transmission 2 the microorganism adhere to the
vaginal epithelium   if germination occur   it promote vaginitis 17 colonization be present in normal woman and occur in 30   at any single time and in 70   over the
course of 1 year   it be a transient asymptomatic event   most commonly from candida
albicans 18 and culture may be positive in asymptomatic individual  
factor associate with the transition from asymptomatic colonization to symptomatic infection be intrinsic to the host   the environment   host behavior   or relate to the
organism itself   intrinsic host factor include diabete   particularly with an increase in
candida glabrata infection 19 it be suggest that glycosuria may contribute to colonization and infection 20 antibiotic use have long be associate with symptomatic
infection and usually occur in woman who be already colonize 21 estrogen use increase colonization and infection with candida species 22 patient who be immunosuppresse   particularly owe to steroid use   tend to have more symptomatic
infection 2 behavioral factor such as orogenital sex can increase infection 23 contraceptive method may increase episode of candidiasis   the use of oral contraceptive pill   an intrauterine device   or a diaphragm with spermicide for contraception
have be associate with an increase in episode 24 about 20   of male partner
be colonize on the penis   but treatment of the male partner to prevent vulvovaginal
candidiasis be not recommend 7
causative organism
 
c albicans be the strain that colonize 98   of woman and be the most common cause
of uncomplicated and complicated case 18 24 it cause almost all acute uncomplicated case and about 70   of complicated case of recurrent vulvovaginal
candidiasis   the remain 30   be cause by c glabrata   c parapsilosis   or a rare
specie 25
sign and symptom
 
symptom of acute infection be a thick white discharge   itch   irritation   soreness  
burn   external dysuria   and dyspareunia   vulvar redness   swell   fissure   or excoriation and vaginal erythema can be see on physical examination   along with a
thick discharge on speculum examination 26
diagnostic testing
 
visualization of pseudohyphae and or blastospore   bud   on saline or 10   koh microscopy   or a positive fungal culture in a symptomatic woman be necessary for diagnosis 5 finding on office base testing for vulvovaginal candidiasis be show in

study have show that diagnosis by history and physical examination alone be
not adequate to diagnose vulvovaginal candidiasis 3 additionally   avoid patient
self diagnosis and phone diagnosis in woman with chronic symptom be recommend because the rate of misdiagnosis be significant 5
uncomplicated versus complicated candida infection
 
uncomplicated infection be most common and be define as sporadic or infrequent
episode with mild to moderate symptom in nonpregnant   healthy woman 5 these
patient respond very well to antifungal therapy   with complete resolution of symptom in 80   to 90   2 five percent to 8   of patient have a prolong course with
a treatment failure   chronic symptomatic infection 18 or rapid relapse after successful
treatment 26 complicated infection be define as 4 or more episode per year   severe infection   non albican infection   or in patient with medical complication
such as diabetes   immunocompromise state   debilitate status   or take immunosuppressive agent 5 7
there be no clear risk factor for a complicated course in one half of these woman  
but they do have an increase rate of vaginal candida colonization 32 the difference
may be alteration of local immunoregulatory mechanism or patient may have
increase sensitivity to yeast with an enhance inflammatory response to colonization
result in symptomatic infection 33 strain of candida have different level of virulence   which can also affect the rate and severity of complicated infection   specie
vary in the secretion of aspartate proteinase   protease   phospholipase   and mycotoxin   these substance can inhibit phagocytic activity and suppress the local immune system in the vagina 17 there may also be genetic factor that contribute to
the development of a complicated course 24

therapy for vulvovaginal candidiasis can be give systemically or topically

bacterial vaginosis
 
bv be a polymicrobial infection and its hallmark feature be a lack of hydrogen peroxideproduce lactobacilli   subsequently   there be an overgrowth of facultative anaerobic
organism 5 specific bacteria often find in patient with bv include gardnerella vaginalis   mycoplasma homonis   bacteroide species   peptostreptococcus specie  
fusobacterium specie   and prevotella specie   among other 42 these bacterial specie can be find among the normal flora of the vagina   see table 1    therefore   it be
the disruption of the vaginal ecosystem   not their mere presence that cause disease  
bv have be associate with additional morbidity in woman   low birth weight  
premature rupture of membrane   and prematurity in pregnant woman be increase
in those bv 43 45 treatment be safe in pregnancy and effective at eradicate symptom 5 however   study have show conflicting conclusion as to whether routine
screening and treatment of bv decrease the risk of preterm premature rupture of
the membrane and preterm delivery 5
a number of infection such as pelvic inflammatory disease   postoperative gynecologic infection   and acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus   hiv   or herpe simplex virus   hsv   2 infection be associate with bv in nonpregnant woman   it be not

significant 48 sexual practice that increase the risk of bv include an increase frequency of intercourse   receptive oral sex   and a great number of sexual partner 49
hormonal concentration and shift such as in pregnancy   with use of exogenous hormone   and the normal menstrual cycle also affect the normal flora and risk of bv 49
presence of a foreign body and use of medication such as antibiotic   douche

recurrent bacterial vaginosis
 
there be no clear definition of recurrent bv   but certainly some woman be trouble by
the problem   after treatment   a single recurrence or more may occur in up to 58   of
woman within 12 month 53 this study also show that risk factor for recurrence
include a history of bv   have a regular sex partner   or have a female sex partner 53

sexual activity   failure to reestablish normal lactobacillus dominant flora   or persistence of a vaginal biofilm 2
treatment
 
treatment of bv can be oral or topical   table 8    all of the azole therapy have equivalent efficacy   therapy can be individualize base on cost   side effect   and mode of
administration   if treatment fail   the patient can often be cure with an additional
course of the same therapy 5 7
for patient with recurrent bv   treatment of sexual partner have not show a benefit
and be not recommend 2 likewise   recolonization attempt with lactobacillus supplement be not recommend owe to a lack of evidence show benefit 2 other
recommendation such as condom use and cleaning of share sex toy between use
seem logical and be not harmful   but have no scientific basis 2

cytolytic vaginosis
 
cytolytic vaginosis occur owe to an alteration in the vaginal ecosystem and be characterize by abundant overgrowth of lactobacilli 70 71 normally   lactobacilli block the
adhesion of yeast organism to the vaginal epithelium   but if overgrowth of lactobacilli
occur   then the vaginal epithelium can be damage   cause dissolution of the
cell 71 it be think that the amount of lactobacilli in the vagina vary accord to
the menstrual cycle   with the most being present in the luteal phase   thus   cytolytic
vaginosis can be at its symptomatic peak before mense and can recur with the menstrual cycle 72
symptom include pruritus   dyspareunia   and vulvar dysuria   the vulva seem to be
normal without erythema   vaginal discharge be white with a pasty appearance and the
vaginal wall can be slightly erythematous   on office base testing   the ph will be

cytolytic vaginosis be diagnose in 5   to 7   of patient 73 74 a high index of suspicion
be need to diagnose this condition and provide relief to these patient  
summary
 
vaginal complaint be common and cause decrease quality of life in woman   rely
on patient history   patient self diagnosis   physical examination   or limited testing be illadvise because these diagnostic method have a high rate of misdiagnosis   although
most case be uncomplicated and respond to a first line therapeutic modality   some
case do not   a methodical   thorough approach will decrease the total time from onset
of symptom to diagnosis   and improve patient outcome

poor correlation between the terminology and medical diagnosis   make research
and clinical management of this spectrum of disorder difficult  
the international federation of gynecology and obstetric   figo   in 2005 convene
an international committee of clinician and investigator from 6 continent and more

aub may describe abnormal hmb or mistime bleeding   and it may be acute or

cervical polyp   aub p   may arise from the cervix itself   may be a prolapse endometrial polyp   or even a leiomyoma appear in the cervical canal or at the external os  
the etiology of true cervical polyp be unknown   although hormonal or inflammatory
function may play a role   cervical polyp commonly occur in the later reproductive

the cause of polyp formation be unknown   but they have be find to contain both
estrogen and progesterone receptor 8 progesterone may have an antiproliferative effect on polyp   as it do on the endometrium   whereas endogenous or exogenous
estrogen may be a risk factor   cellular mechanism propose in the development of
polyp include monoclonal abnormal hyperplasia 9 overexpression of endometrial
aromatase 10 11 and gene mutation 12 13
clinical risk factor for development of endometrial polyp include obesity   tamoxifen use   postmenopausal hormone therapy   and patient with lynch or cowden

less likely to spontaneously resolve 15
polyp be benign in 99   of case 16 a great risk of malignancy be note in postmenopausal woman   polyp find during the evaluation of aub   woman on tamoxifen  
or in woman with polyp large than 1 5 cm   although polyp be not associate with
pregnancy loss   removal may be good in woman undergo therapy for infertility  
there be no guideline for management of a woman with an asymptomatic polyp
who do not undergo polypectomy   the overall risk of recurrence of polyp be small  
the levonorgestrel intrauterine system   lng ius    mirena   have be show to
decrease the recurrent risk of polyp particularly in woman on tamoxifen 17
adenomyosis
 
adenomyosis   aub a   be a condition in which endometrial gland and stroma reside in
the uterine myometrium   induce hypertrophy locally or throughout the uterine fundus
and eventually cause enlargement of the uterine corpus   localize area may be difficult to distinguish from leiomyoma   the incidence of adenomyosis be report to occur
in 20   to 65   of woman and be associate with increase age   it have be report in
small number of adolescent woman   adenomyosis be commonly note in association
with leiomyoma   endometriosis   and early menarche 18 other article have cite an association with severe dysmenorrhea   depression   and even prior uterine surgery 19
the etiology of adenomyosis be undetermined   but theory include invagination of
the endometrium   de novo mu llerian rest   or a metaplastic process   alter molecular
function of endometriotic gland or the junctional zone of the endometrium with the
myometrium   as well as estrogen and progesterone   be also suggest etiologic factor   pituitary hormone   prolactin and follicle stimulate hormone   may be contribute influence   some evidence suggest leiomyoma and adenomyosis may share
a common origin in angionesis and growth factor dysregulation   adenomyosis do
not share pathogenic similarity with endometriosis other than the similar presenting
symptom of pelvic pain 20
physical and pathologic finding in uteri contain adenomyosis include gross
enlargement and a   boggy   feel with the uterine volume and weight above normal parameter   adenomyoma at imaging may appear similar to leiomyoma but do not
exhibit discreet capsular formation and be not easily resect    shell out     histopathology feature endometrial tissue 1 to 2 low power field from the endomyometrial junction  
prominent clinical symptom include hmb with dysmenorrhea or chronic pelvic
pain   although up to 30   of woman be asymptomatic   confirmatory diagnosis
require a hysterectomy speciman   but ultrasound examination or mri imaging
reveal increase uterine volume   thicken myometrium   myometrial cyst   or
increase myometrial heterogeneity with loss of a clear endometrial myometrial junction be highly suggestive of this disorder  
although hysterectomy be the only definitive treatment for adenomyosis  
hormonal therapy be effective for many woman   therapeutic option include combination oral contraceptive   estrogen and progesterone    progesterone only therapy  
gonadotropin release hormone   gnrh   agonist   or aromatase inhibitor   the most
promise progesterone therapy be the lng ius 20 hormonal therapy not only reduce
menstrual volume but dysmenorrhea as well  
procedure aside from hysterectomy have include endometrial ablation or
resection   excision of adenomyomas   or laparoscopic myometrial electrocoagulation  
 
 
abnormal uterine bleeding
 
surgical intervention with postoperative medical therapy may be well than surgery
alone 21 a few report of uterine artery embolization or mri guide focus ultrasound surgery have show some promise 22 23 hysterectomy remain the therapy
of choice for woman who have complete child bearing  
leiomyomata
 
leiomyomas   aub l   be common fibromuscular tumor of the myometrium with a
high prevalence in women24   the large variation in size   location   and number require
subclassification within this figo category   many be asymptomatic and other have
vary rate of growth and secondary symptom   the figo system propose classification of fibroid by location   fibroid may have 1 or more classification due to the
size of the fibroid and therefore its impact on more than 1 site in the uterus   the 3 large
subgroup be intermural   submucosal   and subserosal   leiomyoma also may
involve the broad ligament or cervix  
uterine leiomyoma be benign monoclonal tumor from the smooth muscle myometrium surround by a pseudocapsule of areolar tissue and compress muscle fiber   the most likely etiology be normal myocyte transform into abnormal
myocyte that then grow into clinically apparent tumor   many factor   such as steroid
hormone   environment   genetic   and growth factor relate to angiogenesis and
fibrotic process   contribute to growth and clinical manifestation 25 excessive uterine bleeding relate to uterine fibroid be think to be cause by change in the endometrium and its vasculature 26 27 sixty percent of leiomyoma have abnormal
karyotypes and some of these be see more frequently   trisomy 12   translocation between chromosome 12 and 14   and chromosome deletion or rearrangement 28
some woman may have a family predisposition to leiomyoma 29
steroid hormone have a complex relationship to leiomyoma   estrogen and progesterone and their receptor be involve in fibroid pathogenesis as well as aromatase
and even stem cell   molecular change lead to increase angiogenic growth factor and thus abnormal blood vessel number and function   be suggest to play a role
in fibroid associate symptom as well as dysregulate fibrotic growth factor 26
risk factor for the development of leiomyoma include race   black great than
white    early menarche   hypertension   obesity   and dietary factor   high parity or
short pregnancy interval and tobacco smoking may reduce risk   hormonal contraceptive and ovulation induce agent appear neutral   investigation of vitamin sufficiency or insufficiency and the role of uterine infection be ongoing  
the most commonly report symptom associate with leiomyoma be hmb   pelvic pressure or pain   and reproductive dysfunction   bleeding may be heavy or prolong but myoma be not associate with imb or postmenopausal bleed  
leiomyoma alter the endometrial cavity or protrude into the endometrial cavity
be most associate with hmb and increase the risk of anemia   large fibroid bulk
may be associate with urinary frequency   difficulty empty the bladder   or constipation   dysmenorrhea have be report and dyspareunia may be associate with
anterior or fundal myoma   the presence of fibroid may increase the risk of miscarriage   decrease conception rate   or cause pregnancy complication   include fetal
growth restriction   placental abruption   malpresentation   and preterm labor  
the physical and bimanual examination be the most important first line evaluation
of the uterus   assess uterine size and contour   imaging aid the evaluation of
fibroid   number   size   and location   imaging modality include transvaginal or
abdominal ultrasound   diagnostic hysteroscopy   mri   and hysterosalpingogram  
postmenopausal bleeding or abnormal bleeding may prompt endometrial sampling

to rule out hyperplasia or malignancy as a process separate from the presence of the
fibroid  
some fibroid may be manage expectantly   especially those that be find without
the presence of symptom   but no specific guideline exist   an imaging study at the
time of diagnosis clarifie the absence of adnexal masse and allow documentation
of leiomyoma number   size   and location   annual examination with interim evaluation
if symptom develop allow some patient to be follow conservatively  
in woman with hmb   anemia must be assess and other cause of anemia
exclude  
combination steroid hormone or progestin only hormonal therapy may assist
symptom management of hmb   but do not provide long term treatment of the leiomyoma   the lng ius observational study and systemic review indicate a potential
decrease in uterine volume and bleeding while provide excellent contraception   no
randomize clinical trial be available at this time 30 31
gnrh agonist be the most effective medical therapy for leiomyomata   produce
both amenorrhea and relief of fibroid symptom with a 35   to 60   reduction in uterine size   rebound symptom occur when gnrh agonist be discontinue   long term
use of gnrh agonist may not be desirable due to effect on bone density as well as
menopausal symptom   myalgia or arthralgia   the most common use of gnrh agonist be preoperatively to assist with increase the patient s hematocrit  
other medical agent consider for fibroid management include gnrh antagonist and progestin receptor modulator   none available in the united states    ulipristal
acetate   a progestin receptor modulator   and mifepristone   an antiprogesterone   hold
future promise   although dosage suitable for long term use be not currently determine   endometrial change cause by antiprogestin may appear as cystic glandular
dilation with both estrogen and progesterone effect   hyperplasia   however   do not
occur   although the endometrium may appear thicken on ultrasound   other medication that have be consider for medical management of symptomatic fibroid
include raloxifene and aromatase inhibitor  
surgical therapy have be the traditional treatment for leiomyoma   indication
include symptomatic or bulky myoma   hmb   infertility   or recurrent pregnancy loss  
hysterectomy be indicate for woman who have complete childbearing and be at
risk for associated condition   include neoplasia of the cervix   uterus   or ovary or
those woman with endometriosis   adenomyosis   or fail conservative therapy   medical or surgical   who desire definitive treatment   a sizable myoma that be submucosal
or subserosal may still be manage with myomectomy   but future risk for development
for other leiomyoma remain   hysteroscopic   laparoscopic   and robotic approach
have allow myomectomy to be perform less invasively  
endometrial ablation have perform poorly in woman with submucous or intramural
myoma   whereas laparoscopic myolysis by thermal   radiofrequency   or cryoablation  
be under investigation   uterine artery embolization or uterine fibroid embolization have
perform well for woman who wish to preserve their uterus but who have complete
childbeare   it result in significant fibroid shrinkage with less pain and a short hospital stay than hysterectomy 32 unfortunately   these procedure have result in more
complication and readmission than hysterectomy and success be reduce in the
presence of multiple leiomyoma or great overall uterine size 33 long term success
be less and other intervention may be require if embolization be perform 34
a new technique target individual myoma be magnetic resonance guide
focus ultrasound   mrgfus    this be a noninvasive ultrasound thermal ablation technique   food and drug administration label for this device now allow treatment in
some woman who wish to consider future childbeare   success may be limit by

fibroid number   calcify myomas   and individual fibroid vascularity   or by other uterine
feature   such as adenomyosis   this technique often result in a reduce myoma volume of approximately 40   35 determination of optimal condition for mrgfus and
long term outcome be need   there be no comparison study of this method
with other minimally invasive technique  
few guideline for clinician comprehensively discuss all fibroid treatment   those
from the royal college of obstetrician and gynecologist and the society of obstetrician and gynecologist canada provide treatment guideline   but the most
comprehensive recommendation be from france or the european menopause and
andropause society   which do address integration of both medical and surgical
approach 36 39

simple without atypia  
complex without atypia  
simple with atypia  
complex with atypia  
 
the endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia classification system be an alternative
propose by an international group of gynecologic pathologist in 2000   it do not
correspond directly with who guideline but show well intraobserver reproducibility and may be well at predict progression to malignancy 40
in premenopausal or postmenopausal woman with abnormal bleeding   malignancy
must be exclude   the glandular and stromal architectural pattern determine the
diagnosis of hyperplasia   the high incidence of endometrial hyperplasia without
atypia be see in woman age 50 to 54 versus the high incidence of eh with atypia
be see more commonly in age 60 to 64 41
risk factor for eh be similar to those risk factor for endometrial carcinoma   ec  
and generally involve unopposed estrogen exposure   specific risk factor include
increase age   obesity   early menarche   late menopause   old than 55    polycystic
ovary syndrome   diabete mellitus   nulliparity   tamoxifen therapy   or family history of
ec or lynch or cowden syndrome   eh in woman who have an estrogen produce
tumor or who be estrogen deficient be especially worrisome for a malignant process  
present symptom of eh be most commonly aub or postmenopausal bleed
and less frequently the finding of endometrial cell on cervical cytology  
diagnosis be make by examination and endometrial sampling with or without image   such as transvaginal ultrasound   insufficient cell at the time of endometrial sample warrant repeat sample by endometrial biopsy or dilation and curettage   the
differential diagnosis include endometrial polyp or leiomyomata   the diagnosis of
atypia in eh be most concern for malignancy   neither endometrial biopsy nor endometrial curettage   however   may be completely sufficient to exclude malignancy 42
oncologic consultation be often consider for the management of these patient  
for woman who desire future childbeare   progesterone therapy be the most important treatment for prevention of future malignancy and continue abnormal bleeding  
progesterone option include the follow  
1   norethindrone acetate 5 to 15 mg daily 12 to 14 day per month  
2   medroxy progesterone acetate oral 10 mg daily for 3 to 6 month or 10 mg daily 12

some of these regimen provide excellent contraception   but for woman actively
seek pregnancy   ovulation induction increase endogenous progesterone production in the corpus luteum as well as assist conception  
regression of eh have be document with expectant management or treatment

6 month until regression of hyperplasia be document   if eh recurs   progestin
dosage may be adjust or the lng ius may be consider   if atypia develop   a
reappraisal of treatment with consultation from a gynecologic oncologist be
appropriate  
when disease regression be document   preventive measure should be institute
or regular mense document   alteration of hormone therapy in postmenopausal
woman or expectant management may be consider   if abnormal bleeding develop  
endometrial sampling be require   other medication under consideration for therapy
for woman who desire future childbearing include danazol   gnrh agonist or antagonist   aromatase inhibitor   hysteroscopic resection be under research  
coagulopathy
 
coagulopathy   aub c   be a term that describe a systemic disorder of hemostasis that
manifest as aub or hmb or simply contribute to these entity when other condition be present   woman who require lifelong anticoagulation be also place in
this category   although their management and subsequent irregular bleeding could
be consider iatrogenic   the new figo classification state it be more appropriate
to place anticoagulate woman in the coagulopathy category

von willebrand disease   which affect 1   of the population 44 the mild form be the
most frequently diagnose   the next most common group of coagulopathie be
platelet function defect   factor deficiency and hemophilia be much less frequent  
noninherite cause of coagulopathy include acquire platelet dysfunction   nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug use   renal disease    idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura   or acquire factor consumption   historical question that may provide clue

cervical cancer
epidemiology risk factor
 
the american cancer society estimate that there would be 12 990 new case of
invasive cervical cancer diagnose in 2016   it be estimate that 4120 woman would
die from cervical cancer 1 cervical cancer be most common in hispanic   african
americans   and those woman of low socioeconomic class   these woman have
a high age adjust death rate   risk factor for cervical cancer be high risk human
papillomavirus   hpv    smoke   early sexual activity   increase number of partner  
increase parity   family history   use of oral contraceptive   immunosuppression   and
diethylstilbestrol exposure  
squamous cell carcinoma comprise most cervical cancer case   approximately
80   85     however   the percentage of adenocarcinoma be rise because screen
be well identify dysplastic squamous lesion   cervical cancer   especially at an
early stage   be usually asymptomatic   presenting symptom may include postcoital
bleed and or other irregular vaginal bleeding   diagnosis be make with tissue biopsy  
not pap test   radiation and chemotherapy be generally the treatment   in early stage
cervical cancer up to and include stage ib1   surgery can equal the result of radiation therapy and avoid the risk of destroy ovarian function   fertility sparing option
do exist for properly choose woman with early stage disease  
cervical cancer prevention and human papillomavirus vaccine
 
hpv 16 and   18 be implicate in most case of cervical cancer   along with the woman s immune system and environmental factor   such as cigarette smoking   these two
high risk hpv genotype   16 and 18   account for 55   to 60   and 10   to 15   
respectively   of cervical cancer case worldwide   an additional approximately 12
oncogenic hpv genotype comprise the remainder of the cervical cancer case 2
hpv be associate with anogenital cancer other than just cervical cancer   vaginal  
vulvar   penile   and anal   it be also associate with oropharyngeal cancer   and genital
wart  
the center for disease control and prevention and the american college of obstetrician and gynecologist recommend routine hpv vaccination for females age 9 to
26 to prevent preinvasive and invasive disease   preliminary datum from australia and
canada demonstrate a reduction of preinvasive disease in vaccinated woman 2 there
be three different vaccine available in the united states   a bivalent vaccine   which
cover hpv 16 and hpv 18   a quadrivalent vaccine   which cover hpv 6 and
hpv 11 in addition to hpv 16 and hpv 18   and a nine valent vaccine   which cover
an additional five high risk hpv genotype 3 all three vaccine be administer in a
three dose series with a schedule of 0   1 to 2   and 6 month   current study be monitor the durability of the immune response   there be no current recommendation for
a booster vaccine   the series do not need to be restart if there be a delay in a second or third dose   a local injection reaction of swelling and edema be common   especially with the nine valent vaccine   provider should counsel parent and patient to
expect   and not be alarm by   discomfort and a local site reaction after the vaccination   there have be no significant adverse reaction to the hpv vaccine after great
than 60 million administer dose   vaccine administration during pregnancy should
be avoid   with dose of a series be delay until completion of pregnancy and
breastfeed   inadvertent administration of vaccine during pregnancy be not think
to cause harm base on datum available at this time 3
the advisory committee on immunization practice recommend the nine valent
hpv vaccine   approve by the us food and drug administration in december 2014
 
 
option for malignancy of cervix and uterus
 
for girl and boy age 11 to 12 year   catch up vaccination be recommend through
age 26 for those male and female not vaccinate in the target age range 3 hpv
vaccination of girl at an early age   9 14 year vs 15 26 year   result in high antibody level 3 it be unclear if this increase immune response correlate with vaccine
efficacy   early vaccination be prefer because vaccine be most effective when
give before the onset of sexual activity   therefore before exposure to hpv   vaccination be still indicate even if follow the onset of sexual activity   because it be unlikely a
woman have be expose to all hpv genotype in the vaccine   there be no indication
for hpv testing before vaccination 3
australia have a population base vaccination program with high adherence   a
decrease in high grade cervical abnormality be note within 3 year of program
initiation 2 the united states have see low vaccination rate   only 50   of girl age
13 to 17 year have receive at least one vaccine   only 33   of girl in the recommend age group have receive all three vaccine 3 in june 2016   the society of gynecologic oncology submit seven recommendation to vice president joe biden s
national cancer moonshot initiative   one of the recommendation be for schoolbase hpv vaccination in an effort to improve vaccination rate and therefore
decrease incidence of cervical dysplasia and cancer  
along with a recommendation to mother to vaccinate boy and girl   obstetric and
gynecology health care provider should counsel young woman on the benefit of protect sexual intercourse   provider should advise woman to cease smoking   they
should counsel woman who be immunocompromise of their high risk for persistent hpv infection   provider should encourage all woman to present for routine
screen   immunocompromise woman should follow a strict screening schedule
depend on the clinical situation  
cervical cancer screen
 
hpv infection be usually transient   with spontaneous regression   the lifetime risk of
hpv infection be great than 80    in one study   hpv infection occur at least
once over a 3 year period in 60   of young woman   in young woman   especially those
young than 21 year of age   an effective immune response result in the resolution of
an hpv infection in an average of 8 month after exposure   a total of 85   to 90   of
young woman clear the virus or have undetectable viral load in an average of 8 to
24 month   the few hpv infection that be persistent at 1 to 2 year be more likely
to lead to high grade cervical dysplasia and or cancer   cervical dysplasia usually resolve with the resolution of the virus   whereas persistent viral infection result in
persistent dysplasia 4
newly acquire hpv infection have the same low chance of persistence in woman
old than age 30   however   hpv infection in woman old than age 30 be more likely
to reflect persistent infection   and therefore more likely associate with high grade
dysplasia   untreated high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 progress to cervical cancer in 30   of the case at 30 year 2 this mean 70   do not progress into
cancer and allow the opportunity for conservative management in selective case
where childbearing have not yet be complete   close follow up with colposcopy
every 6 month be require   progression of disease in most hpv related type of cervical neoplasia be slow   because the progression likely take more than 8 to 10 year  
less frequent screening be not unreasonable  
screen program in the united states have lead to decrease in incidence of cervical cancer by more than 50   in the past 30 year   in 1975   the rate of cervical cancer
be 14 8 per 100 000 woman   by 2011   the rate decrease to 6 7 per 100 000

5 year of diagnosis   it be predict that it will take 20 year after widespread vaccination before there be a significant reduction in the incident of cervical cancer case  
screen recommendation apply regardless of hpv vaccination status  
indication for hpv testing   to test for the presence of high risk hpv   be change

65 year and old    coteste    
   one hpv test be approve by the food and drug administration in 2014 for primary cervical cancer screening in woman 25 year and old  
indication for hpv genotyping be currently limit to negative pap test result
  cytology   but positive high risk hpv test result in woman age 30 to 65 year who
be undergo coteste   if the hpv genotype determine infection be with
hpv 16 or   18   colposcopy be recommend 2 otherwise   the recommendation be
repeat coteste in 1 year  
the goal of current screening effort be to balance the benefit of screen with the
risk   which include costly   unnecessary   and anxiety provoke colposcopie   biopsy   and excisional procedure   these additional procedure also potentially negatively affect reproductive outcome   one study find a significant increase in rate of
preterm birth among woman previously treat with excisional procedure for
neoplasia   the recent revision to the screening guideline have incorporate the
powerful negative predictive value of hpv testing and lengthen screening interval

recommendation do not change even in the event of a new sexual partner because cervical
cancer occur a median of 15 to 25 year after hpv infection

cancer treatment be radiation therapy and sensitize chemotherapy   neither standard
surgery   nor chemotherapy radiation therapy spare the option of future childbearing
for woman who be of childbeare age   there be fertility spare surgical option
for woman of childbeare age with early stage cervical cancer   fertility sparing approach be not standard   but they be acceptable in appropriate patient and allow
for fertility with plan for completion surgery once the postpartum period be complete

woman in the united states have a 3   lifetime risk of develop endometrial cancer  
the national cancer institute surveillance   epidemiology   and end result program
database estimate there would be 60 050 new case of endometrial cancer in
2016   with an estimate 10 470 death from endometrial cancer in 2016 14 endometrial cancer be the fourth lead cause of cancer   and the seventh leading cause of
cancer death   endometrial cancer be more common in white woman   but black woman
have a high mortality from the disease   it be uncertain why this disparity exist 1
risk factor be estrogen exposure   tamoxifen use   estrogen produce tumor  
and prior pelvic radiation therapy   woman with body mass index great than 30
have two to three time the risk of develop endometrial cancer   woman with
body mass index great than 40 have significantly short survival and experience
more death unrelated to their endometrial cancer diagnosis when compare with
nonobese woman 15 oral contraceptive use and smoking reduce risk of develop

debate  
   a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test   ogtt   should be perform 6 to 12 week postpartum
as up to 36   of woman have impair glucose tolerance postpartum  
   woman with prediabete postpartum should be offer intensive lifestyle intervention
and or metformin to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes  
 
background
 
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be a condition where woman without a previous
diagnosis of diabetes exhibit abnormal blood glucose level during pregnancy  
in normal pregnancy pancreatic b cell hyperplasia occur from the stimulation of
human placental lactogen and prolactin   result in high insulin level   placental
secretion of diabetogenic hormone   such as growth hormone   corticotropinrelease hormone   placental lactogen   and progesterone   lead to increase insulin
resistance   the inability to overcome the insulin resistance of pregnancy despite
b cell hyperplasia lead to gdm   gdm in turn carry increase risk for the mother
and neonate to include preeclampsia   birth weight over 4000 gram   and shoulder
dystocia   therefore   the identification and management of gdm be important 1 3

the prevalence of gdm in the united states be about 9   base on datum from
desisto and colleagues4 use prevalence estimate from the pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system   pram   with a range from 1   to 25   depend on
ethnicity of the mother and the diagnostic criterion use for the diagnosis 2 5 the
ongoing obesity epidemic have lead to more type 2 diabetes in woman of childbeare
age with a great number of pregnant woman with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes 6
therefore   it be reasonable to test woman with risk factor for type 2 diabetes
  box 1   at their first prenatal visit with standard diagnostic criterion use in nonpregnant
patient   box 2   7
those woman identify to have diabete in the first trimester would be classify
as type 2 diabetes and not gdm   where that label be reserve for diabete diagnose
in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and be not clearly type 1 or type 2
diabetes  
the obstetrician gynecologist care for a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes should be knowledgeable about the maternal and fetal risk relate to that diagnosis   antepartum maternal and fetal surveillance   the role of ultrasound for monitor
fetal growth and well be   the decision make process for the timing and route of
delivery   manage blood sugar while in labor   and postpartum assessment and
counsel  
in addition to routine pregnancy care   prenatal care of woman who have gestational diabetes should focus on those condition that be more common in woman
with glucose impairment   short term complication more common in woman with
gestational diabete include large for gestational age infant and macrosomia   preeclampsia   polyhydramnio   stillbirth   and increase neonatal morbidity   there be not
an increase risk of congenital malformation in these infant   the long term complication associate with gestational diabete extend beyond the postpartum
period and neonatal period   these may reflect the infant s increase risk of develop childhood obesity   impair glucose tolerance   and metabolic syndrome  
for the mother   gestational diabetes be a marker for the development of type 2 diabete later in life  
the most common adverse neonatal outcome associate with gestational
diabete be fetal macrosomia and be large for gestational age   persistent
maternal hyperglycemia increase a woman s risk of have an infant with
macrosomia and excessive maternal weight gain may also increase that risk

macrosomia in turn be then associate with increase risk of operative delivery

polyhydramnio be more common among woman with gestational diabetes   it
do not seem to be associate directly with increase perinatal morbidity or
mortality   the exact mechanism have never be determine   but a contributing
factor be think to be fetal polyuria   although there be report of stillbirth occur among woman with gestational diabetes   the mechanism be think to be primarily relate to poor glycemic control and do not seem to be increase

the neonatal morbidity from mother who have gestational diabete include hypoglycemia   hyperbilirubinemia   hypocalcemia   hypomagnesia   polycythemia   respiratory distress   and cardiomyopathy   these risk be relate to maternal hyperglycemia  
diagnosis of gestational diabete
 
in the united states a 50 g oral glucose challenge test   ogct   and 100 g oral
glucose tolerance test   ogtt   have be the standard to screen and diagnose
gdm since o sullivan and coworkers8 publish a study in 1964 use these test
with collection of whole blood glucose measurement   carpenter and coustan9
later convert o sullivan s whole blood glucose value to plasma glucose value
with validation of the conversion by sack such that current guideline use the carpenter and coustan plasma glucose value   however   the world health organization   who   have implement a 75 g 2 hour ogtt for the diagnosis of gdm and an
observational study by sack and colleagues10 use those criterion show a
continuous relationship between fast   1 hour   and 2 hour ogtt value with
birth weight percentile and macrosomia   later two randomize control trial use the who 75 g 2 hour ogtt show that identify and treat gdm reduce
excess fetal growth and related complication 11 12 in 2008 the hapo   hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome   trial   a multicenter   multinational epidemiologic study use the 75 g ogtt in nearly 25 000 pregnant woman   show at
which level of mild hyperglycemia adverse pregnancy outcome occur   the
study show that increase level of plasma glucose be associate with birth
weight great than the 90th percentile   cord blood serum c peptide level great

mack    tomich
 
diabete and pregnancy study group   iadpsg   adopt the 75 g ogtt for the
diagnosis of gdm   however   adoption of the 75 g ogtt with a low threshold
for the diagnosis of gdm be expect to increase the incidence of gdm from
5   to 6   to 15   to 20   because only one abnormal value be sufficient to
make the diagnosis   the american college of obstetrician and gynecologist
  acog   and later the national institutes of health consensus conference assert
that there be no adequately power randomize control trial use the
iadpsg who criteria that show improved pregnancy outcome compare
with the standard criterion   additionally site be the potentially negative consequence of identify a large new group of woman with gdm   include medicalization of pregnancy with increase intervention and cost   and the ease of
screen with a 50 g ogct such that the iadpsg who criterion be not adopt
by acog  
therefore   the optimal screening diagnostic approach for gestational diabete
remain controversial   universal screening be suggest because some woman without
risk factor develop gdm   the american diabetes association   ada   and acog suggest that those at low risk for gdm need not be screen   those at low risk include
age less than 25 year   body mass index   bmi   25 or less before pregnancy   not of hispanic   african american   south or east asian   or pacific islander decent   no firstdegree relative with diabetes   no history of abnormal glucose tolerance   and no history
of poor obstetric outcome  
most us guideline favor the two step approach for screen   first administer a
50 g nonfaste ogct test at 24 to 28 week   follow by a 100 g fast ogtt for
woman who have a positive screening result 14 15 however   clinician may also use
the iadpsg who one step approach with use of a 75 g 2 hour fasting ogtt with
a low threshold for diagnosis of gestational diabetes then with the two step
approach   table 1   box 3   16

than 90 mg dl two or more occasion in a 2 week period   or 1 hour postprandial
glucose value great than 120 mg dl 12 24 26
when need   insulin provide the most rapid glucose control   insulin may be
start at a total daily dose of 0 7 to 1 0 unit kg actual body weight 27 obese
woman may require high insulin dosing and insulin need may double or triple
during the pregnancy   if both the fasting and postprandial glucose be above
goal   half of the total daily dose may be give as the long act basal insulin
and half may be give as rapid act insulin   the rapid act insulin be split between the three meal and preferably dose base on patient use an insulin carbohydrate ratio   eg   one unit of rapid act insulin per 15 g of carbohydrate    basal
insulin commonly use in pregnancy and typically dose once a day include longacte insulin analogue detemir and glargine   which be less likely to cause hypoglycemia than old basal insulin   such as neutral protamine hagedorn   nph   
because of the relative lack of a peak 28 glargine have an increase affinity to the
insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor   so there be theoretic concern that it may
contribute to adverse event in pregnancy   but adverse event have not be
observe to date 29 31 because of the lack of adverse finding with glargine  
woman with pregestational diabetes may be continue on glargine during
pregnancy   but it be suggest that those start basal insulin in pregnancy start
with nph or detemir 28 32
nph insulin be cheap than the long act insulin analogue   but may predispose
to hypoglycemia because of its peak level by 6 to 7 hour of first dose   rapid acting
insulin analogue use in pregnancy include lispro and aspart and have replace regular insulin at meal because of rapid onset and short duration of action   which provide well postprandial glucose control with less between meal hypoglycemia 28 a
comparison of insulin be provide in table 2   dosing of insulin should be individualize and adjust as need   patient benefit from frequent contact either by telephone   e mail   or one on one visit with a certify diabetes educator 28
two option of oral agent be available in the management of gdm and include
metformin and glyburide   they have be show to be effective with short term
safety in gdm with both be category b in pregnancy   neither   however

gestational diabete
 
have be approve by the us food and drug administration for this indication  
evidence from randomize trial and observational study of oral antidiabetic
agent show that maternal glucose level do not differ substantially between
woman treat with insulin and those treat with oral agent   and a
meta analysis show no consistent evidence of an increase in adverse maternal
outcome with use of glyburide or metformin compare with insulin 14 because
both oral agent cross the placenta and long term safety datum be not available  
a role for counseling when prescribe these oral agent be suggest by the
ada and acog 7 14
glyburide be a sulfonylurea that increase insulin secretion by bind to pancreatic
b cell adenosine triphosphate calcium channel receptor   it should not be use in patient with a sulfa allergy   the usual dose of glyburide be 2 5 to 20 mg per day in divided
dose   from 20   to 40   of woman on glyburide may require the addition of insulin to
maintain glucose goal 14 metformin be a biguanide that reduce gluconeogenesis in
the liver and stimulate glucose uptake in peripheral tissue   because of its gastrointestinal side effect of diarrhea it be start at 500 mg once a day with food and may be
titrate up to 2500 mg per day if tolerate   give as divide dose with meal    in the
mig trial 33 half of the woman randomize to metformin required insulin to achieve
glucose goal and in a randomize control trial of glyburide versus metformin in
gdm   35   of the woman randomize to metformin required insulin and 16   randomize to glyburide require insulin   this demonstrate that glyburide may be superior to
metformin in gdm 14
antenatal fetal testing
 
woman who have euglycemia with nutritional therapy and diet alone and who have
no other maternal complication   such as macrosomia   preeclampsia   intrauterine
growth restriction   or polyhydramnio   be not at increase risk of stillbirth 34 therefore perform antepartum testing and surveillance commence at 32 week of
gestation be not require   in those patient who require oral antihyperglycemic agent
or insulin   gdm a2   to maintain euglycemia   initiation of antepartum testing at
32 week with twice weekly testing be recommend   some center perform twiceweekly nonstress testing with amniotic fluid assessment twice weekly   modify biophysical profile    other center initiate antepartum testing surveillance weekly at
32 week and increase surveillance to twice weekly at 36 week gestation   acog
have suggest antepartum fetal assessment for woman with gdm and poor glycemic control without consensus about the management of those patient who be
well control  
assessment of fetal growth
 
some clinician perform an ultrasound evaluation shortly after the diagnosis of gestational diabetes be make and after an evaluation of maternal glycemic control   many
clinician perform an ultrasound at the end of pregnancy for an estimate fetal
weight and a discussion concern option for timing and method of delivery   unfortunately   no estimation of fetal growth perform well   all current method indicate
that there be a variance of approximately 20   in identify the large for gestational
age fetus 35
timing of delivery
 
one of the key issue relate to the management of such patient be whether to induce
labor and or at what time   the potential benefit of induction be   in theory   the avoidance of late stillbirth and delivery relate complication from continued growth

especially if macrosomia have be identify   the disadvantage include the risk of
induction with the possible need for cesarean section if the induction fail and
for neonatal morbidity if the delivery be perform before 39 week   there be no
datum to support perform an induction of labor in a woman with well control
gestational diabete with a suspicion of suspect fetal macrosomia or evolve macrosomia for concern of a shoulder dystocia with its sequela   for those patient with
gdm a1   current practice pattern be the beginning of a discussion about the possibility
of induction when the patient reach 40 0 7 week and then recommend induction
by 41 week   the general consensus be those patient should not be induce before
39 week gestation   for those patient with gdm a2 take either oral hypoglycemic
agent or insulin   the recommendation be that those patient be deliver at 39 week
gestation   the method of delivery should be base on a discussion relative to the risk
of a shoulder dystocia base on a recently take estimate fetal weight   a schedule
cesarean delivery to avoid birth trauma can be offer to these patient with an estimate fetal weight of more than 4500 g   this be the current recommendation of
acog 34 in patient without gestational diabetes   an elective cesarean delivery be
reasonable when the estimate fetal weight be more than 5000 g  
in summary   there be no need for woman with gdm a1 who be control by diet
and lifestyle modification to be deliver early   an induction may be offer at
40 week gestation and induction recommend at 41 week   for those patient
with type a2 diabetes require either oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin   the recommendation be that they be schedule for an induction of labor at 39 week gestation
and that a discussion concern the potential risk of an induction of labor should
occur   a single third trimester ultrasound at or near the due date should be perform
to evaluate for macrosomia and to then have a discussion of the risk and benefit of a
cesarean delivery  
intrapartum glucose management
 
woman with gdm a1 often require no intrapartum insulin   those woman with gdm
a2 should be monitor every 1 to 2 hour during active labor and 5   dextrose or
insulin infuse as need to maintain glucose control 36 consideration should be
give to have woman take long act basal insulin reduce that dosing by half
of their usual dose the night before and morning of delivery   woman with gdm rarely
need oral agent or insulin after delivery   but before discharge short term glucose
monitoring be useful to ensure euglycemia  
postpartum care
 
at 6 to 12 week postpartum a 75 g 2 hour ogtt should be perform because up
to 36   of woman with gdm may have abnormal glucose tolerance 14 because
gdm be associate with maternal risk for diabetes   woman should be test every
1 to 3 year thereafter if they pass the postpartum glucola   with the frequency of
test dependent on other risk factor   such as family history   prepregnancy bmi  
and need for insulin or oral glucose lower agent during pregnancy   ongoing
screening may be achieve with any recommend screening test   hemoglobin
a1c   fast plasma glucose   or 75 g ogtt use nonpregnant threshold
  ada 2016    17 if woman with past gdm be identify to have prediabete   hemoglobin a1c 5 7   6 4    impaired fasting glucose   or impair glucose tolerance   
both metformin and intensive lifestyle intervention prevent or delay progression
to type 2 diabetes   in these woman lifestyle intervention and metformin reduced
progression to diabetes by 35   and 40    respectively   over 10 year versus
placebo 37 therefore   the ada suggest that metformin be recommend
 
 
gestational diabete
 
for high risk individual   those with a history of gdm   bmi   35 kg m2   and or
progressive hyperglycemia   and or rise hemoglobin a1c despite lifestyle
intervention 38
contraception
 
the current 2016 center for disease control and prevention recommendations39 for
contraception use for patient with a history of gestational diabetes be that none of the
method for contraception include oral contraceptive   both combined or progestin
only   be contraindicate   although any form of contraception be acceptable   the present recommendation be for the use of long act reversible contraception   larc  
because of the minimal risk of unplanned pregnancy with that method of contraception   there be no evidence that use oral contraceptive either estrogen progesterone
or progesterone only increase the risk of develop diabete   these patient can
breastfeed and should be encourage to do so   the long term benefit of perform
breastfeed on the development of type 2 diabete have not yet be clarify  
summary
 
gdm and newly diagnose type 2 diabete in pregnancy be grow public
health concern relate to the rise in obesity   to minimize complication to
the mother and child   diagnose and manage gdm be critical   however   the ideal
screen   diagnostic testing   and management for gdm remain debate  
future randomize control trial need to address whether adopt strict
guideline will improve pregnancy outcome and what the optimal diet and
treatment should be for woman with gdm   postpartum screening and longterm monitoring for diabetes be equally important give the increase risk for conversion to type 2 diabetes over time in those who have have gdm   lifestyle intervention and metformin significantly reduce progression to type 2 diabete in
these woman

key point
   proteinuria be sufficient but not necessary when define preeclampsia   and the method
use to measure urinary protein level have change   hypertension without proteinuria
but with severe feature be diagnostic  
   low dose aspirin be effective for the prevention of preeclampsia   the number need to
treat be 42 to 18 as risk change from low to high  
   the recommend dose of low dose acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of preeclampsia in
the united states be 81 mg daily start at 12 to 28 week   gestation  
   datum suggest that treat mild to moderate blood pressure have maternal benefit   however   fetal neonatal risk be uncertain  
 
introduction
 
practice obstetric care provider recognize that the management of patient with
hypertension in pregnancy offer a myriad of reward   challenge   and uncertainty  
when address the uncertainty   clinician resort to evidence base guidance for
answer   type of evidence assume an establish hierarchy with systematic review
at the top1   fig   1    systematic review often use meta analysis to combine result

american college of obstetrician and gynecologist   acog   publication hypertension in pregnancy challenge previous criterion use to define preeclampsia   offer
guidance on the use of low dose acetylsalicylic acid   asa   in pregnancy for the prevention of preeclampsia   and comment on the management of mild to moderate hypertension 2 this article discuss these topic use the lens of already publish
meta analysis  
define preeclampsia
 
in 1972   the acog establish the classification scheme of hypertension associate
condition in pregnancy   eg   gestational hypertension   preeclampsia   chronic hypertension   and chronic hypertension with superimpose preeclampsia   2 4 over the
last 26 year   the define feature of preeclampsia be modify several time
  table 1    recent modifications2 emphasize proteinuria   300 mg 24 h   be sufficient
but not necessary to make the diagnosis of preeclampsia   furthermore   proteinuria
can be establish use a 24 hour urine collection or a urine protein creatinine   p c  
ratio   only when these method be not available be a qualitative urine dipstick assay
acceptable   the addition of the p c ratio be sound   but the propose threshold of 0 3 be
open to critique   a systematic review   which include 7 study and perform a
receiver operator curve analysis   be use to derive clinically useful value for the
p c ratio5   table 2    the investigator suggest that a value of less than 150 be useful
as a screening tool to determine who should be test use a 24 hour urine measurement   whereas a value great than or equal to 600 could obviate the 24 hour speciman   importantly   neither the 24 hour urine or p c ratio be practical test for
immediate decision making and office practice   in these setting   a urine dipstick be
appropriate  
the national heart lung and blood institute provide guideline for the diagnosis of
hypertension associate conditions6 and 10 year later revise the criterion 7 revision
include removal of edema as a criterion and specific blood pressure criterion be
change   previously 6 patient could be their own control such that blood pressure
comparison before and after 20 week   gestation be use to establish patientspecific threshold for disease   ie   30 mm hg increase in systolic or 15 mm hg increase in diastolic after 20 week    the revision provide a single threshold value
for all patient   140 mm hg systolic or 90 mm hg diastolic    it be determined that

woman with a prior normotensive pregnancy have the low risk    1    and healthy
nulliparous woman have a 2   to 4   risk   assign absolute risk to any give patient
can be difficult   because of the many variable in play   use a baseline risk of 10   to

datum from 2 additional meta analysis   the baseline risk before treatment have a profound impact on the nnt   patient at high risk for preeclampsia be more likely to
derive a benefit from the use of low dose asa  
the study include by the usptf use dosage between 49 and 150 mg   see
table 3    there be no evidence of a dose response relationship in the usptf study 9
however   a dosage of at least 75 mg d have a great benefit in reduce risk of preeclampsia than a dosage less than 75 mg d   risk ratio   rr    0 58   95   confidence

organization and suggest by the usptf be show in table 4   although not specifically study   the 81 mg dose be later recommend because of its availability in
the united states and because it be within the aforementioned range   75 150 mg   18 all
study in the usptf analysis start low dose asa after 12 week   gestation   timing
of administration vary significantly across the study consider   12 28 week   
and there be no difference in the effect among patient start treatment before

across the united states   there be an emphasis on reduce the time from identification
of severe range blood pressure    160 mm hg systolic or   110 mm hg diastolic   to
treatment in woman with hypertension during pregnancy or the postpartum period  
the goal be effective treatment within an hour 19 20 meta analyses21 show that treat
mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy reduce the risk of develop
severe range blood pressure   table 6    the finding from these early study be
recently support by datum from an open label   randomize control   multicenter

order to achieve tight control versus less tight control 22 there be no difference
in composite neonatal or maternal outcome   in this trial   n 5 881   the proportion of
woman who develop preeclampsia be not different between the group   this
find make sense   because the development of proteinuria be not affect by
tight blood pressure treatment and define feature predate those put forth by

5 16    although not specifically evaluate in this study   it seem that application of
recently propose define feature might yield a reduction in preeclampsia when
attempt to achieve tight blood pressure control for patient with mild to moderate
hypertension   with a national emphasis on avoid severe range blood pressure to
avert the risk of intracranial hemorrhage   it be logical to offer treatment to woman
with mild to moderate hypertension as long as there be no harm   in an early study of
2635 woman   a reduction of 10 mm hg in mean arterial pressure cause by blood
pressure medication be associate with a 176 g decrease in birthweight 23 in a

agent and 33   of patient expose have a small for gestational age fetus compare
with no patient in the control group  
there be no convincing datum to guide the blood pressure threshold for initiate
treatment of mild to moderate hypertension   the uk national institute for health
and care excellence   nice   suggest 150 mm hg systolic and or 100 mm hg diastolic 25 other professional organization have not provide guidance   there be
limit datum indicate the optimal blood pressure target after initiation of medical
intervention   in the publish study describe 22 a target of 100 mm hg diastolic
be use for the group with less tight control and in the tight control group a diastolic
of 85 mm hg be the target   there be no difference in infant bear at the 10th or
3rd percentile   table 7   
on balance   the maternal benefit of treat patient with mild to moderate hypertension seem to outweigh any neonatal risk   however   the paucity of datum to guide the
appropriate blood pressure threshold for the initiation of treatment or target value
once treatment begin suggest a need for patient counseling   acog recommend
not treat woman with mild gestational hypertension or preeclampsia who have
persistent blood pressure of less than 160 mm hg systolic or 110 mm hg diastolic  
however   this guidance be subject to change in light of recently publish datum

summary discussion
 
systematic review with meta analysis represent the high level of evidence use to
guide clinical practice   the define criterion use to diagnose preeclampsia have
evolve   and be likely to continue to evolve   proteinuria be sufficient but not necessary
when define preeclampsia   hypertension without proteinuria but with severe feature be diagnostic   the method use to measure urinary protein level have change  
proteinuria can now be determine use the urine p c ratio   whereas qualitative urine
dipstick assessment have become less favor   the gold standard remain the 24hour urine test   the efficacy of low dose aspirin in prevent preeclampsia be a function of baseline risk   with the nnt suggest 42 to 18 as risk change from low to
high   for practical reason   the recommend dosage in the united states be 81 mg
daily start at 12 to 28 week   gestation   datum suggest that treat mild to moderate
blood pressure have clear maternal benefit with very little fetal or neonatal risk   the
appropriate blood pressure to trigger the initiation of therapy and the target blood
pressure once treatment begin be unknown

introduction
 
shoulder dystocia and postpartum hemorrhage represent two of the most common
emergency face in obstetric clinical practice   both require prompt recognition
and management in order to avoid significant morbidity or mortality   although certain
risk for shoulder dystocia and postpartum hemorrhage exist   many case occur in the
absence of these factor   early identification   communication   and familiarity with
management option for both condition can significantly minimize the morbidity
associate with these complication  
institutional protocol and algorithm for the prevention and management of both
shoulder dystocia and postpartum hemorrhage have become mainstay for clinician  
the goal of this review be to summarize the diagnosis   incidence   risk factor   and management of shoulder dystocia and postpartum hemorrhage

shoulder dystocia
definition
 
accord to the american college of obstetrician and gynecologist   acog   
shoulder dystocia be define as the inability for the clinician to complete the delivery
of the fetus with gentle downward traction after the emergence of the head   although
the definition be subjective in nature   relief of an impact shoulder against symphysis
pubis require additional ancillary maneuver to deliver the fetus 1
the objective definition of shoulder dystocia be a prolongation of head to body time
interval of more than 60 second 2 despite the numerical nature of this definition in the
literature   it be not acknowledge by the acog or by the royal college of obstetrician
and gynecologist   rcog   1 3 4
incidence
 
in a review article on the definition and incidence of shoulder dystocia among 28 publication with more than 16 million total birth   the rate of shoulder dystocia be
0 4   5 since 2000   among all birth   the rate of shoulder dystocia approximate
1 4   if publication reliant on international classification of disease   icd   code
be exclude   during vaginal delivery   the report likelihood of shoulder dystocia in
15 publication be 0 7   overall   though it be high among report from the united
state   1 4    than other country   0 6    5
four study stratify the rate of shoulder dystocia among diabetic patient   gestational or pregestational   and nondiabetic patient   notably   the rate of shoulder
dystocia be 1 9   for woman with diabete compare with 0 6   for those without  
a relative difference of 216    despite this increase risk   the 4 publication note
that only 4   of the report shoulder dystocia occur in those with gestational
or pregestational diabetes 5
far   6 of the study review provide the rate of shoulder dystocia among
woman with and without operative   vacuum or forcep   vaginal delivery   the rate
of shoulder dystocia be 2 0   for those who have operative birth and 0 6   if they
do not   a relative difference of 254    in these 6 report   21   of the shoulder dystocia occur follow operative vaginal birth  
risk factor
 
in addition to the aforementioned gestational or pregestational diabete and operative
vaginal delivery   obtain a history of prior shoulder dystocia may be the most important risk factor   simply put   shoulder dystocia reoccur   a history of prior shoulder
dystocia   which be knowable at first prenatal visit   may have one of the high likelihood of future occurrence of an impact shoulder   of 9 study that provide the
rate of shoulder dystocia   recurrence be note in 12   of vaginal birth   not only be
recurrent shoulder dystocia more common but it also seem to be more morbid for
the neonate   although the rate of neonatal brachial plexus palsy be 19 of 1000 in those
with the first shoulder dystocia   it increase to an estimate 45 of 1000 with recurrent
shoulder dystocia   a relative increase of 136   6 an important caveat to these estimate   however   be the fact that true incidence of recurrent shoulder dystocia remain
unknown because of many clinician and patient not attempt a trial of labor and
deliver via cesarean in subsequent pregnancy when a complicated delivery or
neonatal injury occur 1
the acog s practice bulletin on shoulder dystocia recognize 10 risk factor that
can be categorize into antepartum or intrapartum1   table 1    antepartum risk

with concomitant neonatal trauma could be predict   when consider 17 antepartum and intrapartum variable   this model attest to the unlikelihood for clinician to
identify the woman who will have shoulder dystocia and   most importantly   predict
neonatal morbidity   such as neonatal brachial plexus palsy   in summary   although
risk factor for shoulder dystocia be elucidate   they be insufficiently sensitive to
be clinically useful to avert neonatal injury   like persistent neonatal brachial plexus

prevention
 
as previously mention   the risk of reoccurrence in woman with previous shoulder
dystocia may be as high as 12   and the second shoulder dystocia be more likely to
be associate with injury to the newborn than the first shoulder dystocia 1 4 6 most
subsequent delivery   however   do not result in shoulder dystocia   thus   leave clinician and patient with a difficult decision   to prevent injury with subsequent delivery   cesarean delivery should be discuss as an option   but   as note in the
acog s practice bulletin   its benefit be uncertain 1 clinician should consider the status of diabetes   estimate fetal weight   progression of labor   and if possible avoid
operative vaginal delivery   the recognize risk associate with primary cesarean
delivery should also be consider and discuss   with the ultimate delivery route
appropriate after proper counseling  
to avert shoulder dystocia   clinician may undertake unnecessary primary cesarean
for suspect macrosomia   up to 4   of primary cesarean delivery be do for suspect macrosomia 8 vagary exist with regard to sonographically estimate fetal
weight 9 furthermore   the risk of maternal death with cesarean delivery and the risk
of persistent neonatal brachial plexus palsy with vaginal birth be similar   make
the excessive rate of cesarean delivery for estimate fetal weight unwarranted in
most case 8 10 therefore   the acog   rcog   and the society of maternal fetal medicine   smfm   recommend that cesarean delivery for the indication of presume macrosomia should be offer only to those with a sonographic estimate fetal weight
great than 5000 g in nondiabetic patient and 4500 g in diabetic patient 1 3 8
management
 
both the acog and rcog have national guideline on shoulder dystocia   and they
have slightly different suggestion on how to resolve the impact shoulder 1 3
when face with a shoulder dystocia   it be incumbent on the clinician to remain calm
and communicate clearly the situation   the first step   accord to the rcog   be to
call for additional help   the support team may include additional nurse   midwive  
obstetrician   maternal fetal medicine subspecialist   neonatal resuscitation team  
and anesthetist   when additional assistant arrive   they should be clearly inform
that this be a situation of shoulder dystocia   accord to grobman and colleague 11
the emergency call for help represent an important component of a shoulder dystocia
protocol associate with a significant decrease in the likelihood of neonatal brachial
plexus palsy  
accord to the acog   the performance of the mcrobert maneuver should be the
initial step to resolve shoulder dystocia   this maneuver consist of hyperflexion and
abduction of the hip   which putatively lead to cephalad rotation of the symphysis pubis and flattening of the lumbar lordosis   thus   mechanistically relieve the impact
shoulder 1 in contemporary practice in the united states   woman who deliver vaginally
be often already in the mcrobert position rather than lithotomy despite no evidence
that this preventive positioning decrease the rate of shoulder dystocia in all delivery 3 thus   when a true shoulder dystocia do occur   it may be reasonable to
ensure that the woman be in mcrobert position and if a family member be assist
with the maternal position   replace by a member of the labor and delivery staff  
in addition to or in conjunction with the mcrobert maneuver   suprapubic pressure
may be use to assist with the delivery of the impact shoulder   the rcog s guideline remark that suprapubic pressure improve the effectiveness of mcrobert 3 the
mechanism of application of pressure over the symphysis presumably decrease the
fetal bisacromial diameter and rotate the anterior fetal shoulder into the wide oblique
 
 
obstetric emergency
 
pelvic diameter   the shoulder be then free to slip underneath the symphysis pubis
with the aid of routine axial traction 3 once these two simple maneuver have be
apply   routine or gentle traction in the axial direction may be apply to assess if
the anterior shoulder have be release 3 in 2 large multicenter study   the use of
mcrobert with or without suprapubic pressure relieve about two third of the shoulder dystocia 12 13
if these initial maneuver be unsuccessful in relieve the shoulder dystocia   clinician have a choice of reposition labor patient to their hand and knee
  all four maneuver   or perform internal manipulation of the fetus   the all four maneuver in one case series be demonstrate as a rapid   safe   and effective technique
that resolve 83   of shoulder dystocia case without any further maneuver 14
although the rcog s guideline consider this technique useful for mobile woman after the simple maneuver be unsuccessful   the acog s practice bulletin do not
even mention it   perhaps because of the rarity of its use in the united states 1 3 in a
secondary analysis of the consortium on safe labor   hoffman and colleagues12 note
that among 2000 shoulder dystocia   the all fours maneuver be use in 22 instance
or about 1   of case of impact shoulder   regardless of infrequent utilization in the
united states   it be notable that the all fours technique reportedly have a success rate of
more than 80   and could be consider if feasible and if the clinician   include the
nurse   be experience 14
in the aforementioned secondary analysis   hoffman and colleagues12 find that delivery of the posterior shoulder be associate with an 84   rate of achieve delivery
compare with 24   to 72   with other internal maneuver   the rate of neonatal injury
be similar whether the posterior arm be extract   8    or other maneuver be
use   6   14     thus   they recommend extraction of the posterior arm if mcrobert
and suprapubic pressure be unsuccessful 12 mechanistically   delivery of the posterior
arm reduce the diameter of the fetal shoulder to accomplish delivery   which can be
accomplish by grasp the fetal wrist and gently withdraw the posterior arm
in a straight line   this maneuver be associate with fracture of the neonatal humerus  
however   this may be secondary to the refractory nature of shoulder dystocia rather
than the maneuver itself 3
if the shoulder dystocia persist or if extraction of the posterior be not feasible  
manual rotation of the neonatal shoulder should be attempt   previous eponym
attribute to those credit to these maneuver   wood screw   anterior shoulder
abduction   and rubin maneuver   posterior shoulder rotation    should be avoid 3
in contrast and because the most spacious aspect of the pelvis be the sacral hallow  
vaginal access should be initially attempt posteriorly   to accomplish this   the
woman should be at the end of the bed   which allow the clinician s entire hand to enter
posteriorly   pressure apply to the posterior aspect of the posterior shoulder abduct
the shoulder   and rotation of the shoulder in oblique diameter assist in resolve the
impaction   if neither the extraction of the posterior arm nor the rotation of the posterior
shoulder effectuates delivery   apply similar pressure to the posterior aspect of the
anterior and rotation in a similar oblique diameter may be attempt 3
after the initial and internal maneuver be perform and a shoulder dystocia persist   most clinician be in an exceedingly unusual situation   as these resolve more
than 99   of all should dystocias   preferably the assistance that be summon at
the initial diagnosis of shoulder dystocia have arrive and can assist with effectuate
the delivery   neither the acog s nor the rcog s guideline on the topic comment
on whether the maneuver should be reattempte by another clinician   consider
the complexity of third line maneuver and the clinical situation   it may be reasonable
to retry the initial maneuver with the summon assistance  
 
235
 
 
236
 
dahlke et al
 
third line maneuver to resolve shoulder dystocia include cleidotomy   intentional
clavicular fracture    symphysiotomy   separation of the cartilage of the pubic symphysis    and the zavanelli maneuver   cephalic replacement and subsequent cesarean delivery    the most commonly describe of these remain the zavanelli maneuver  
although it be use quite rarely as exemplify by combine the result of 2 multicenter
study   combine datum of hoffman and colleagues12 and chauhan and colleagues13
indicate that among 178 735 delivery   with 3195   2    shoulder dystocia   the zavanelli maneuver be use once or 0 001   of all delivery   lastly   it be worth note that
maternal safety with the zavanelli maneuver be unknown   and the procedure be associate with neonatal hypoxic ischemic injury and brachial plexus palsy  
in summary   shoulder dystocia remain an uncommon   unpredictable   and unpreventable obstetric situation   which can be manage with appropriate maneuver  
institutional protocol have show improve neonatal outcome   communication remain paramount when face with this obstetric emergency   preparation and understanding of initial   internal   and rarely use third line maneuver will allow the clinician
to approach shoulder dystocia in a calm and stepwise manner   with experience  
shoulder dystocia can be approach with resolve and confidence and not as a nightmare for clinician 15 16
postpartum hemorrhage
diagnosis
 
significant variation exist regard the amount of blood loss that constitute clinically relevant postpartum hemorrhage   therefore   a previous review of national guideline on the topic demonstrate a variety of acceptable definition for postpartum
hemorrhage 17 compound this problem far be the fact that the most common
method for estimate blood loss   the deliver provider visually estimate the
amount of blood loss   have be show to be highly inaccurate by underestimate
blood loss by up to 30   to 50   18
one definition endorse by multiple national organization   include the acog  
smfm   the american college of nurse midwive   acnm    the association of
woman s health   obstetric and neonatal nurse   awhonn    and the california
maternal quality care collaborative   cmqcc    be the follow   a cumulative blood
loss of great than 1000 ml or blood loss accompany by sign symptom of hypovolemia within 24 hour follow the birth process 19 20 an alternative definition use
by the world health organization   who   be blood loss of 500 ml or more within
24 hour after birth 21 one possible explanation for the variation between these definition may be the difference in resource rich versus resource poor population of the
organization   respective intend audience   for purpose of this review   discussion
of postpartum hemorrhage in the setting of a resource rich environment be review  
because of the inaccuracy of visual estimate of blood loss   one effort to improve quality and postpartum hemorrhage recognition involve support staff to formally measure
and quantify cumulative blood loss after every birth   although require more resource
than qualitative measurement   the goal be to more accurately assess actual blood loss
and minimize delay in resuscitative measure when necessary   this method for blood
loss measurement be support and extensively review by the awhonn and the
prefer measurement method in the cmqcc s obstetric hemorrhage toolkit 20 22
incidence
 
postpartum hemorrhage occur in an estimate 4   to 6   of all pregnancy 23 24 the
rcog estimate 3 of 1000 experience severe hemorrhage   define as receipt of blood
 
 
obstetric emergency
 
transfusion   hysterectomy   and or surgical repair of the uterus 25 of those who experience postpartum hemorrhage   by far the most common cause be uterine atony   or the
inability of the uterus to contract effectively   which account for more than 80   of
case   other common culprit include retain placenta tissue   vaginal or cervical
trauma   and known or develop coagulopathy 23
risk factor
 
many risk factor exist that may increase a woman s chance of postpartum hemorrhage   these risk include preexist condition that may be know or apparent in
the antepartum period   placental factor   or those that become apparent in the course
of labor   it be important for the clinician to realize   however   that like shoulder dystocia  
most woman who experience postpartum hemorrhage do not have any know risk
factor  
preexist factor identify by the acog and rcog s national guideline include
history of postpartum hemorrhage   preeclampsia   overdistende uterus   macrosomia  
twin   hydramnio    obesity   anemia   and asian or hispanic ethnicity   antepartum condition include prolong   augment   or rapid labor   episiotomy   operative delivery  
infection   and induction of labor   finally   placental factor include placenta abruption  
previa   retain placenta   and abnormal placentation 17 23 25 of the risk factor
review early   the rcog s guideline on postpartum hemorrhage specify those
condition that put a woman at high risk and include suspect or prove
placental abruption   odd ratio   or   13   99   confidence interval   ci    7 6 12 9    know

prevention
 
preemptive measure to minimize postpartum hemorrhage have be one of the most
study subject in obstetric literature   much of this inquiry have focus on the active
management of the third stage of labor   amtsl    traditionally   amtsl consist of 3
intervention   administration of a uterotonic agent   immediate umbilical cord clamp   and control umbilical cord traction to facilitate placenta delivery   the relative
importance of each respective component of amtsl have recently be question  
for example   a recent randomize trial find that control cord traction contribute
minimally to control blood loss in resource rich setting if oxytocin be administer 26 furthermore   emerge evidence have suggest a neonatal benefit of delay
cord clamp   thus   the primary focus of current research have focus on the type  
dose   and timing of the uterotonic agent give  
more than 30 randomize trial have compare various dose of medication  
include oxytocin   oxytocin ergometrine   syntometrine    prostaglandin   misoprostol  
carboprost   dinoprostone    carbetocin   oxytocin analogue    and tranexamic acid in the
setting of vaginal or cesarean delivery   the most commonly use and most readily
available medication for postpartum hemorrhage prevention regardless of delivery
mode remain oxytocin   with traditional dosing 10 to 40 u in 1 l intravenously   iv  
over 4 to 6 hour 17 27
one promise new agent for postpartum hemorrhage prevention in the setting of
cesarean delivery be tranexamic acid   an antifibrinolytic amino acid derivative of lysine  
a recent systematic review and meta analysis of 9 randomize control trial   rct  
demonstrate significant decrease blood loss compare with standard prophylactic
oxytocin 28 despite these positive finding in 2365 woman in 9 rct   the author
recommend further investigation to assess the effect of this medication on thromboembolic event and mortality

management
 
a variety of tool be available to the clinician to manage postpartum hemorrhage  
include medication   surgical intervention   and radiologic embolization procedure  
there be no randomized trial that have establish the order for which each intervention should occur   but generally   the least invasive intervention should precede a more
invasive one   national guideline from the acog and rcog vary with regard to the
optimal management of postpartum hemorrhage 23 25 both guideline do   however  
recommend each institution establish a policy or protocol for how postpartum hemorrhage be identify and treat   one such algorithm that can serve as a template for a
protocol if one do not exist be include in the cmqcc s obstetric hemorrhage toolkit 20 although certainly beneficial to the clinician and institution   it must be state
that these initiative have yet to be prospectively evaluate with regard to improve
postpartum hemorrhage outcome 17
table 2 summarize the most common medication available to treat ongoing postpartum hemorrhage   it be important to recognize that the primary mechanism of action
of these medication involve improve uterine tone   although this may help resolve
most cause of postpartum hemorrhage   less common cause   such as trauma or
coagulopathy   must always be consider   especially if the hemorrhage be not responsive to initial medical management  
surgical option include tamponade procedure   such as uterine packing   and more
recently balloon tamponade device   these intervention may require a learning curve
on the part of the clinician to implement correctly if he or she be unfamiliar with they   in
addition   although balloon tamponade device have be incorporate into various
protocol and algorithm   none have be compare with any other treatment strategy in an rct 29
surgical treatment option   include brace suture   such as the b lynch or square
suture   vessel ligation   uterine or internal iliac    and hysterectomy   require the ability to
perform a laparotomy and a surgeon experience in the various technique   give the
rarity of hemorrhage that require this type of treatment   coordination with subspecialist and surgeon experience with these technique be paramount   highlight this
importance be a recent survey of french obstetrician that find almost 1 in 5 respondent who do not have mastery of any of the surgical technique for postpartum hemorrhage management 30
finally   when the aforementione surgical intervention be require   intensive
resuscitative effort be often occur concurrently   communication between anesthesia provider and the surgical team remain paramount   surgeon should clearly
communicate the state of ongoing bleeding and the intervention anticipate   anesthesia can also clearly communicate both the stability of patient along with current
and anticipate blood product use   one well establish method to facilitate this
communication and maximize blood product availability include incorporation of
massive transfusion protocol into management protocol  
massive transfusion protocol emphasize early utilization of blood product   and it
be currently the preferred method of resuscitative effort 31
summary
 
shoulder dystocia and postpartum hemorrhage represent two of the most common
emergency face in obstetric clinical practice   both require prompt recognition
and management in order to avoid significant morbidity or mortality   shoulder dystocia
be an uncommon   unpredictable   and unpreventable obstetric situation occur in
approximately 0 6   to 1 4   of all delivery and can be manage with appropriate
 
 
obstetric emergency
 
intervention   include initial maneuver   such as mcrobert and suprapubic pressure   internal maneuver   such as anterior or posterior shoulder rotation   or thirdline maneuver   include zavanelli   cleidotomy   and symphysiotomy   postpartum
hemorrhage occur more commonly   in 4   to 6   of all delivery   and carry significant risk of maternal morbidity   postpartum hemorrhage prophylaxis   such as the
amtsl   be well establish   an understanding of the medical   surgical   and radiologic
treatment option available to the clinician be necessary   the first step in address
both obstetric emergency involve effective communication of the clinical scenario
in order to appropriate the correct resource   institutional protocol and algorithm for
the prevention and management of both shoulder dystocia and postpartum hemorrhage be become increasingly more common and can provide invaluable resource
for deliver provider   in summary   shoulder dystocia and postpartum hemorrhage
will undoubtedly be experience by obstetric provider   knowledge of its cause   preventative strategy   and management option be paramount

   aneuploidy    genetic screening    noninvasive prenatal screening    cell free dna
   chorionic villus sample    amniocentesis
key point
   aneuploidy screening should be offer to all woman at their first prenatal visit  
   cell free fetal dna screening be currently recommend for high risk population only and
should be consider a screening test rather than a diagnostic test  
   chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis carry a small but potential risk of pregnancy
loss but remain the only diagnostic methodology available presently  
   woman should receive thorough pret counseling regard the risk and benefit of
available option and should receive thorough postt counseling with individualized
interpretation of result  
 
introduction
 
approximately 3   to 5   of pregnancy be complicate by birth defect or genetic
disorder 1 chromosomal abnormality be present in approximately 1 in 150 live
birth 2 and congenital malformation remain the lead cause of infant death and
a lead cause of childhood death 3 these chromosomal abnormality include aneuploidy   define as have one or more extra or missing chromosome    translocation  
duplication   and deletion  
the most common chromosomal disorder be trisomy 21   down syndrome    with an
incidence of 1 per 800 live birth 4 trisomy 13 and 18 can also result in live birth  
though with a significantly low incidence 2 4 sex chromosome aneuploidy be
less common than autosomal aneuploidy 4 the only know viable monosomy be
monosomy x   turner syndrome    incidence be describe in table 1

risk of aneuploidy increase with maternal age   table 2   2 4 other factor also influence patient   risk in any give pregnancy   include the presence of birth defect or
soft marker on ultrasound and past obstetric history   particularly if it be notable for a
prior pregnancy affect by aneuploidy or another genetic disorder   a past family history of aneuploidy increase current pregnancy risk of aneuploidy   especially if a
parent be a balanced robertsonian translocation carrier   though most case be sporadic and secondary to chromosomal nondisjunction  
patient report many different motivation for pursue aneuploidy screening or
prenatal diagnosis   some may choose pregnancy termination if the defect be identify at an early enough gestational age   other may choose to pursue screen
or test to allow they time to process the diagnosis and seek experienced
clinician who may be able to aid they in preparation for care for an affected
infant and to care for their child after delivery   some birth defect   such as
some neural tube defect   may be eligible for prenatal treatment with subsequently improve neonatal outcome 5 all patient choose to undergo
screen or testing should receive counseling regard risk   benefit   and
limitation of their choose testing plan from their health care provider or genetic
counselor   it be important to note that aneuploidy screening and testing decision
be heavily value drive   a frank discussion of the benefit   risk   and limitation
of test be key in ensure that care be appropriate for each patient s individual

prenatal diagnosis
 
history of screen
 
initial screening for birth defect be develop in the 1950 with ultrasound and have
become increasingly prominent in obstetric care   real time gray scale image
become available in the 1970 and improve prenatal diagnosis by allow for evaluation of pregnancy early in gestation   aim of ultrasonography include determination of gestational age and fetal number   evaluation for malformation   testing of fetal
well be   and assistance with invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedure 6
amniocentesis   the first available prenatal chromosomal diagnostic testing option  
be first describe in the 1950 7 amniocentesis have become increasingly safe and
be now use for several purpose   include genetic screening and infectious evaluation   chorionic villus sample   cvs   be another diagnostic test and can be perform
early in gestation  
subsequently   noninvasive test   include serum analyte screening and cell free
dna screen   be develop for purpose of screen for genetic abnormality
within a pregnancy  
in 2007   the american congress of obstetrician and gynecologist   acog  
release   acog practice bulletin no   77    which recommend make aneuploidy
screening or invasive testing available for all woman   ideally at their first prenatal visit 8
this idea be revolutionary at the time   as previously only woman who be consider to be at high risk have be offer these test  
screen test
 
most prenatal testing be intend for screen   these test include serum screen  
carrier screen   and ultrasound   the goal of these test be to identify woman with
pregnancy at high risk of chromosomal abnormality or birth defect   although ultrasound can be diagnostic   such as in the case of open neural tube defect   serum
screening be intend only to identify woman with pregnancy at an increase risk  
numerous option for serum screening be available with vary test criterion and
timing of employment   table 3   4
first trimester screen
 
the first trimester screen be a commonly use screening test that include a combination of serum screening and ultrasonographic examination of the nuchal translucency
perform between 10 and 13 week 6 day   gestation   serum marker   include free
beta human chorionic gonadotropin   hcg   and pregnancy associate plasma protein
a   be collect with a capillary blood sample between 9 and 13 week 6 day   gestation   a risk estimate be then develop that incorporate maternal age   past pregnancy
history   number of fetus in the current gestation   weight   race   serum marker   and
nuchal translucency measurement   some risk estimator also incorporate presence or
absence of visualize nasal bone   this risk estimate be then express as a ratio   such
as 1 in 10   one in 300 be commonly use as the cutoff for a high risk result   but the cutoff be laboratory dependent   the detection rate for trisomy 21 varie from 82   to 87  
depend on the laboratory   use a 5   screen positive rate 4
a nuchal translucency of great than 3 mm be significantly associate with both
aneuploidy and structural malformation 4 9 12 in the initial observational study
describe this phenomenon   35   of patient with a nuchal translucency measurement great than 3 mm subsequently have confirm aneuploidy 9 a subsequent
observational study confirm increase prevalence of cardiac defect in patient
with a nuchal translucency great than 3 5 mm with chromosomally normal

pregnancy 13 risk of other anomaly   include single gene defect and central nervous system   cardiac   skeletal   and abdominal wall defect   be also significantly
increase in these pregnancy 10 it be   therefore   recommend that any woman
with a thicken nuchal translucency undergo a target ultrasound and be offer
a fetal echocardiogram to assess for presence of other structural cardiac malformation regardless of whether aneuploidy be present or absent 4
benefit of first trimester screening include the early gestational age at which result be provide   allow patient and provider time to interpret result and
make decision surround further pregnancy care   include pursuit of further diagnostic testing   genetic counseling   maternal fetal medicine consultation   or termination
if desire   there be several drawback to this screen as well   this test rely on the
availability of certify   experienced sonographer to perform the nuchal translucency
measurement   it have be previously demonstrate that a measurement discrepancy
of only 0 5 mm significantly decrease the sensitivity of this test 14 the test s improve
sensitivity over the quadruple marker screen also vary with gestational age   the test
have improve detection at 11 week   though performance characteristic be similar
to the quadruple marker screen at 13 week 15
quadruple marker screen
 
the quadruple marker screen   or the quad screen   be the initial serum screen test
that become available in the 1990   it be still commonly use today   particularly in
 
 
prenatal diagnosis
 
patient who present for care after the first trimester   which comprise more than 25  
of patient use public health clinic 16 the quad screen may be perform between
15 and 22 week   gestation and involve serum measurement of protein secrete by
the pregnancy   include hcg   alpha fetoprotein   afp    inhibin a   and unconjugate
estriol   these protein measurement be combine with the patient   age   race  
weight   number of fetus in the current gestation   diabete status   and gestational
age to provide a risk estimate   detection rate be slightly low than that of the firsttrimester screen   with a report detection rate of 81   use a 5   screen positive
rate 4
advantage of the quad screen include its ability to screen for open neural tube defect in addition to aneuploidy   serum afp be secrete by the fetus and be present in
the amniotic fluid and   therefore   also maternal serum   it also do not require a
specially train sonographer to perform and   thus   may be more readily available
to some provider  
several center may offer variation on the quad screen   include the triple screen  
which do not include inhibin measurement 17 or the penta screen   which also include hyperglycosylate hcg 18 these test do not seem to have improve test
characteristic  
integrate   stepwise sequential   and contingent screen
 
numerous screening modality incorporate both a first trimester screen and the quad
screen   these modality include integrated screening   the stepwise sequential
screen   and the contingent screen   integrate screening involve perform a first
trimester screen   of which the result be not provide to the patient or provider   and
subsequently perform a quad screen   all of these value be then incorporate into
a single risk estimate to provide patient a comprehensive risk of her second trimester
risk of aneuploidy   the detection rate be 96    the high of any available serum
screen other than cell free dna   with a 5   screen positive rate   downside to this
approach include its relatively late availability of result   limit the time in which
patient and their provider may have to make important decision about future care  
both the stepwise sequential screen and the contingent screen make first trimester
screen result available to patient   the stepwise sequential screen involve perform the first trimester screen and the quad screen   result be available to woman
after their first trimester screen   allow for early counseling and diagnosis for
patient at high risk of aneuploidy   the contingent screen involve perform a
first trimester screen for all woman   after which woman be stratify into high    medium    and low risk group   the high risk group be then offer a diagnostic test  
the low risk group have no further test   the intermediate risk group be offer
quad screen   the detection rate vary between 80   and 94   for this screening
method   with a 5   screen positive rate  
cell free fetal dna
 
cell free dna   commonly refer to as noninvasive prenatal screening   become
commercially available in 2011   this relatively new technology involve collect a
maternal serum sample   from which cell free fragment of dna from the pregnancy
be isolate   this cell free dna be primarily placental in origin and be release from
apoptotic trophoblast   fetal fraction increase with gestational age but be reliably
great than 10   as early as 10 week   gestation   notably   fetal fraction of great
than 4   be require for reliable analysis   this cell free dna be then evaluate by one

sequence   or interrogation of single nucleotide polymorphism   19 depend on
which laboratory be run the analysis   result be typically report with aneuploidy
detect or no aneuploidy detect or as high   or low risk for aneuploidy and with sex
chromosome information if desire  
this screening test have the high available detection rate of all available screening
test for trisomy 21 with a detection rate of 99   on a recently update meta analysis 20 detection rate for trisomy 18   13   and sex chromosome abnormality be
significantly low than for trisomy 21   table 4   20 it be important to note that at present  
cell free dna for aneuploidy screening be only recommend by the acog for woman
with high pret risk of aneuploidy   as describe in box 1   it be also notable that the
study that provide the test characteristic describe early exclude patient who
do not have sufficient fetal fraction to provide a risk estimate   it have subsequently
be find that an inconclusive result significantly increase aneuploidy risk   with
low fetal fraction significantly associate with aneuploidy   particularly trisomy 13
and 18 21 other factor that may influence fetal fraction include weight   with obese
woman have an increase risk of low fetal fraction   and low gestational age 21 22
this test should be clearly convey to patient as a screening test rather than a
diagnostic test   the positive predictive value for trisomy 21 in the population for
whom it be currently recommend be very high   however   positive predictive value depend on the prevalence of the disorder within the population   therefore   the positive
predictive value be expect to be significantly low in an average risk population   a
recent retrospective cohort study out of 2 academic center identify 105 patient
with cell free dna result consistent with autosomal trisomy   of these   aneuploidy
be only confirm in 82   by karyotype   with the remainder of patient have normal
antenatal or postnatal karyotype 23 previous study have show that patient   misunderstanding of this test be significant despite pret counseling 24 notably   in the
aforementione cohort   9 patient undergo termination of pregnancy without diagnostic confirmation of a chromosomal abnormality 23 any result should be interpret with the aid of a genetic counselor in order to provide further guidance as to

indication for cell free dna screen
   maternal age great than 35 year at delivery
   ultrasonographic finding indicate increase aneuploidy risk
   history of prior pregnancy affect by a trisomy
   parental balanced robertsonian translocation increase risk of trisomy 13 or 21
   high risk first trimester or second trimester aneuploidy screening result
datum from cell free dna screen for fetal aneuploidy   committee opinion no   640   american
college of obstetrician and gynecologist   obstet gynecol 2015 126 3   e31 7  
 
evaluate for presence of major anomaly identifiable in the first trimester   as this
would alter a priori aneuploidy risk   in one retrospective cohort   16   of patient
be find to have ultrasound finding that alter counseling and recommendation
regard testing or screening modality   include incorrect pregnancy date   embryonic or fetal demise   twin gestation or presence of an anomaly 25 in those case in
which a cystic hygroma or anomaly be identify   patient may choose to undergo diagnostic testing rather than screen   allow for early prenatal diagnosis 25
other benefit of cell free dna include its ability to accurately identify fetal sex with
excellent accuracy and fetal rh status in pregnancy at risk of rh isoimmunization 26
food and drug administration approve cell free dna technology for anti kell and
other source of isoimmunization be not yet available in the united states   several laboratory have begin to report on other autosomal aneuploidy or for microdeletion  
however   these test be not currently validate and be not recommend at present 4 27 in fact   a retrospective analysis evaluate a small number of case yield
0   positive predictive value for evaluate microdeletion   give low prevalence of
microdeletion syndrome   positive predictive value for most microdeletion be not expect to surpass 10   28 use of cell free dna have also not be widely study in
multiple gestation   and use be currently not recommend in this set 27
it be also worth note that occasionally   cell free dna screening will reveal maternal
chromosomal abnormality or concern   include maternal mosaicism or   rarely  
maternal malignancy 29 patient should be counsel of this possibility before proceed with screen   maternal chromosomal abnormality or malignancy may
result in nonreportable or false positive result   other possible source of falsepositive result include vanish twin or confine placental mosaicism   it be also
worth note that although cell free dna have the good detection rate for trisomy 21
of any screening modalitie   sequential screening continue to have an improved
detection rate for all chromosomal abnormality over cell free dna   indicate that
many other chromosomal abnormality that may be identify with traditional serum
screening may be miss with cell free dna 30
ultrasound only
 
ultrasound be now ubiquitous in pregnancy management   nearly all woman receive at
least one ultrasonographic examination of their pregnancy during a routine obstetric
care   and many receive more than one   the primary function of ultrasound and obstetric care be for confirmation of date as well as surveillance for birth defect  
many patient choose to pursue ultrasound screen only for evaluation of malformation or marker for aneuploidy   as second trimester transabdominal ultrasonography
 
251
 
 
252
 
carlson    vora
 
perform between 18 and 23 week have become routine in prenatal care to evaluate for
anatomic anomaly   many patient also undergo first trimester ultrasonography via
either a transvaginal or transabdominal route to evaluate for viability   pregnancy number  
and for evaluation of major anomaly that can be identify in the first trimester   such as
anencephaly or cystic hygromas   some anomaly have know association with particular aneuploidy or chromosomal defect   increase the likelihood of the presence of
these condition when identify  
diagnostic testing
 
diagnostic testing allow patient to know with as much certainty as possible
whether their pregnancy may be affect by a particular genetic condition   the
most common indication for diagnostic testing in the united states currently be
advanced maternal age or maternal age of 35 year or old on the estimate
date of delivery   other common indication include positive aneuploidy screening result   know family history of genetic disorder   or anomaly identify on ultrasound   although diagnostic testing be recommend by the acog to be available
to all woman   regardless of maternal age   patient should be counsel before proceed on risk of pregnancy loss  
chorionic villus sample
 
cvs have decrease in frequency with the recent increase uptake of cell free dna
screen   it remain the only diagnostic test available in the first trimester and allow
for diagnostic analysis   include fluorescence in situ hybridization   fish    karyotype  
microarray   molecular testing   and gene sequence   cvs be perform between 10
and 14 week   gestation   cvs have be perform before 9 week in the past   though
this have show to increase the risk of limb deformity and   therefore   be no long
recommend  
cvs may be perform via either transcervical or transabdominal approach   via
either approach   chorionic villi be collect for genetic evaluation under ultrasound
guidance without enter the amniotic sac   cvs allow for early prenatal diagnosis  
subsequently decrease time of uncertainty and allow for early   and   therefore  
safe   pregnancy termination if desire   a disadvantage of cvs   however   be that
approximately 1   to 2   of cvs result may reflect confine placental mosaicism
rather than true fetal chromosomal abnormality   confine placental mosaicism
may increase the risk of have a small for gestational age infant 31 pregnancy loss
attribute to cvs be approximately 1 in 455 on the most recent estimate 32 33
amniocentesis
 
amniocentesis   similar to cvs   have decrease in frequency with increase utilization
of cell free fetal dna screen   it remain the only diagnostic test available in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and may be perform at any gestational age after 15 week   use this technique   a sterile needle be introduce into the amniotic sac
under ultrasound guidance   and amniotic fluid be obtain and send for testing   in addition to evaluation for genetic disorder   amniocentesis may also be use to evaluate
for presence of intra amniotic or fetal infection via culture or polymerase chain reaction or for neural tube defect by measure amniotic fluid alpha fetoprotein and
acetylcholinesterase   complication be more common at early gestational age  
pregnancy loss attribute to amniocentesis be approximately 1 in 900 on most recent
estimate 32 33
 
 
prenatal diagnosis
 
cytogenetic evaluation
 
chromosome analysis from cvs and amniocentesis sample be the most reliably predictive method of identify pregnancy affect by chromosomal disorder   however   some issue with cytogenetic testing have be identify that may limit the
clinical utility of these method  
mosaicism refer to tissue that contain 2 or more distinct cell line   it be think
to reflect true mosaicism when multiple colony from multiple culture reveal the
same result   pseudomosaicism refer to a single cell with a different genetic
makeup than the other and be usually not clinically significant   mosaicism may
also arise in primary cell culture   when this occur   it reflect pseudomosaicism
rather than true mosaicism   particular to cvs   confine placental mosaicism occur
in approximately 1   to 2   of pregnancy   although this do reflect true mosaicism   it carry different clinical concern for the fetus than for other pregnancy  
as confine placental mosaicism also cause false positive cell free dna result  
amniocentesis be prefer over cvs for diagnostic testing in case of positive
cell free dna   with some trisomy   particularly trisomy 15   a diploid fetus often
arise secondary to trisomy rescue   which do increase the risk of uniparental disomy and subsequently increase risk of prader willi and angelman syndrome   cell
culture failure also rarely occur and be more common with sample via cvs than
with amniocentesis  
multiple testing methodology be available   design to detect different type of
genetic abnormality   large deletion and duplication may be identify with karyotype in more than 5 million base pair   whereas small deletion and duplication may
be identify with microarray technology at as small as a 50 000 base pair level 34 fish
technology be available for identification of major autosomal aneuploidy or for
select deletion and duplication   such as digeorge syndrome   single gene disorder often require more targeted molecular approach to identify whether or not a
particular mutation in a particular panel of gene be present or absent   as detection
of aneuploidy be the most common indication for invasive testing   fish be often the first
test that be send   this technology do not require cell culture   thus   result be often
available within 48 hour   despite that these result be obtain from a diagnostic
procedure   these result should still be consider a screen and should be confirm
via karyotype give rare report of both false positive and false negative result 35
microarray can also be perform on uncultured cell and   therefore   can also result
in a more rapid turnaround time   result can also be obtain from nonviable cell
with this technique and   thus   may be more likely to result in case of stillbirth   give
that microarray be able to detect both aneuploidy and small deletion and duplication with rapid turnaround   it be now recommend for evaluation of structural abnormality as the initial testing strategy along with fish   rather than conventional
karyotype 33
as availability and uptake of cytogenetic testing with microarray increase  
increase number of chromosomal abnormality without know clinical consequence have be identify   which may increase parental anxiety when one of these
variant of uncertain significance be identify   in these case   parental study be
often consider to determine whether the variant be present in either parent   if so  
it be more likely to be of little to no clinical significance   give that 1 7   of structurally
normal pregnancy without aneuploidy will have a variant of unknown significance
detect 36 patient opt for an amniocentesis with a normal anatomic survey
should be counsel about the possibility of the finding of a variant of uncertain clinical
significance with microarray test 33

preimplantation genetic diagnosis
 
preimplantation genetic diagnosis   pgd   be now widely available and may allow for
even early detection of chromosomal abnormality   this procedure be perform after in vitro fertilization   ivf   by manipulation of the embryo to either remove a polar
body or to remove a single cell from the blastocyst   this procedure allow for detection of the abnormality before embryo transfer so that only unaffected embryo be
transfer back   it be recommend that all pregnancy conceive with ivf pgd
be offer confirmatory testing with cvs or amniocentesis as false negative report
be possible37 with an anticipated negative predictive value of normal fish of
81   38 the grow body of literature surround pgd illustrate minimal risk outside
of the cost of this procedure 33
summary
 
all woman should be offer aneuploidy screening or diagnostic testing during pregnancy   just as importantly   available option should be explain to patient and family in depth   most notably include the risk and benefit of each option   and how
result might be report   patient who choose cell free fetal dna technology should
be counsel that the test remain a screening test for aneuploidy at this time and that
microdeletion testing continue to have poor positive predictive value due to the low
prevalence of these disorder   it be not recommend that patient undergo more than
one screen modality but rather that woman who have positive screen and wish to
pursue further testing be counsel on diagnostic testing with amniocentesis and cvs
so as not to delay diagnosis   amniocentesis and cvs be increasingly safe with low
rate of pregnancy loss and should continue to be available to all woman who desire
diagnostic testing regardless of risk factor or presence or absence of anomaly  
 
abstract  
background   gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be a common pregnancy complication characterize by hyperglycaemia with onset or first recognition during pregnancy   risk factor include family history of diabetes   previous gdm  
genetic predisposition for gdm type 2 diabetes   insulin resistance condition such as overweight   obesity and ethnicity  
woman with gdm be at high risk for fetal macrosomia   small for gestational age   neonatal hypoglycaemia   operative
delivery and caesarean delivery   the aim of this narrative review be to summarize the most recent finding of diagnosis and
treatment of gdm in order to underline the importance to promote adequate prevention of this disease   especially through
lifestyle intervention such as diet and physical activity  
method   the research be conduct use the follow electronic database   medline   embase   web of science

gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be a common condition characterize by impaired glucose
tolerance result in hyperglycemia with onset or
first recognition during pregnancy   this condition
usually resolve after delivery   1    the importance
of recognize and treat this condition have be
prove   indeed   woman with gdm be at high risk
for pregnancy and delivery complication   include infant macrosomia   infant considerably small for
their gestational age   neonatal hypoglycemia   operative delivery and caesarean delivery   2    additionally  
woman who be affect by gdm have more than 7fold increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes   with the
high occurrence rate in the first five year after
pregnancy   child bear to mother with gdm be
also more likely to develop impaired glucose tolerance   3    gdm be widespread all over the world
  4 6    it be estimate to affect 1   to 14   of pregnancy in the united states annually   depend on the
population study and the diagnostic test use   the
prevalence have be steadily increase with the rise
of obesity and type 2 diabetes   1   7    high prevalence
of gdm be find among hispanic   african   american   native american   and asian or pacific islander
woman   whereas caucasian woman have the low
rate of gdm   1    as many woman do not receive
screen for diabetes mellitus before pregnancy   preexist diabetes be sometimes wrongly classify as
gdm   1   
the first classification of diabetes during pregnancy date back to 1949 and be propose by
priscilla white   8    she consider a cluster of
variable include age at onset   diabete duration  
metabolic   and vascular complication   and classify a series of diabetes class range from a   more
favorable   to f   less favorable    8    this classification
have be amend several time   in 1978   the late
version of white s classification be publish   in
this update version   gdm be consider a separate
category and class e and g have be delete   9   
the classification of the american college of
obstetrician and gynecologist   acog   substantially challenge the clinical utility of the one
 
propose by white and take into account also the
presence or absence of metabolic complication   10   
at present   the diagnostic category   diabete in
pregnancy   refer to all case of hyperglycemia
during pregnancy which also include gdm and
pre exist diabetes   pe    pe in turn include
both pre gestational type 2 diabetes mellitus   dmt2  
and type 1 diabetes mellitus   dmt1    2    finally  
accord to the definition of gdm   both case of
undiagnose dm   overt diabetes   identify in early
pregnancy and true gdm which develop later during
pregnancy should be include in the gdm category
  11   
 
2   etiology and risk factor of gdm
in early pregnancy   during the first trimester and
the first half of second trimester   fast and post
prandial glucose be usually low than in nonpregnant woman   1   12    whereas the second half
of the pregnancy be characterize by insulin resistance   indeed   in non diabetic woman the normal
insulin production balance the insulin resistance
and maintain normal glucose level   12    balance the physiologic insulin resistance be way hard
in woman with pre exist hyper insulinemic condition   e g   overweight   obesity   polycystic ovary
syndrome   pcos   or metabolic syndrome    they
be the one that typically show a high risk of
develop gdm during second and third trimester
of pregnancy   13 15    fast blood glucose level
be low in this period compare to non pregnant
woman   due to insulin independent glucose uptake
by the fetus and placenta   diabetogenic placental
hormone   such as human placental lactogen hormone   hpl   cause postprandial hyperglycemia   12   
gdm occur when receptor respond inadequately to
insulin stimulus because of hpl and alteration of the
   cell   result in failure to cope with the metabolic
challenge of pregnancy   16    therefore   prevention
strategy apply to type 2 diabetes may be successful in the prevention of gdm as well   4    the onset
of gdm be associate to several risk factor include parity   advanced maternal age   family history of
diabete mellitus   previous gdm   non white race

woman with gdm be at high risk of hypertensive disorder or preeclampsia and cesarean delivery
  13   22 27    these risk be far increase in case
of poor glycemic control   22   
furthermore   gdm be likely to increase the
incidence of spontaneous abortion   preterm labor  
polyhydramnio   urinary tract infection and postoperative postpartum infection   thromboembolism

gdm undergo postpartum glucose screen   3    a
body mass index   bmi     25 kg m² double the risk
of future dmt2   other significant risk factor for
progression to diabetes after gdm be a family history of diabetes mellitus   non white ethnicity   old
age and previous gdm treat with insulin   latin
american woman with gdm present an increase
risk of develop dmt2 within five year after
pregnancy   the mother s gestational weight gain and
baby s birth weight do not seem to influence the future
risk of develop dmt2   also   genetic predisposition can influence the early conversion to dmt2
  35    some author find that obstetric complication
like preterm delivery and hypertensive disease during pregnancy increase the risk of future onset of
dmt2   2   3   11   
all these factor know to influence the future risk
of diabete be usually not consider in prediction
model for dmt2   3    however   post natal counseling to woman with gdm should include information
on their individual risk factor and an adequate follow up with general practitioner should be plan  
woman should be test every 1 3 year if their 412 week 75 gram   g   oral glucose tolerance test
  ogtt   be normal   frequency depend on their other
risk factor   family history   bmi   insulin use during

overweight   obesity   insulin resistance   7    the prevalence of overweight and obese woman of reproductive
age and the age of childbearing be increase   13   
international federation of gynecology and obstetric   figo   guideline suggest excessive weight gain  
short stature   polycystic ovary syndrome   history of
diabete mellitus in first degree relative   past history
of poor pregnancy outcome   macrosomia   preeclampsia and multifetal pregnancy be risk factor for
gdm   13    furthermore   pharmacological therapy
for other disease may also increase the risk of develop gdm   17 19    nevertheless   slightly over half
of woman with gdm have at least one of these
risk factor   support the importance of testing for
gdm all woman   13   
genetic factor be also important   since the
introduction of genome wide association study
  gwass   many loci be associate with type 2
diabetes   20    gdm genetic loci have be previously relate to dmt2 even if not all woman with
gdm develop dmt2   the loci that seem to be more
relate to gdm be those correlate with insulin
resistance   like insulin receptor substrate i or peroxisome proliferator activate receptor gamma    14  
15   21    the study on the interaction of these gene
with environmental factor be in process and it might
be important to settle new strategy to prevent dmt2

4   screening and diagnosis
previously   patient with family history of diabetes  
previous adverse pregnancy outcome   glycosuria and
obesity be offer screen for gdm   however  
those criterion alone fail to identify half of woman
with this condition   therefore in 2014 the usa preventive service task force make a recommendation
to screen all pregnant woman for gdm at or beyond
24 week of gestation   40    a gold standard for early
gdm screening be not identify   the 75 g   1 and 2
hour ogtt should be use   even if many obstetrician use a two step screening process   start with
the 50 g ogtt   2   
woman should be inform that the diagnosis of
gestational diabetes lead to increase monitoring
and may result in increase medical intervention during pregnancy and labor   49   
the one step approach rationale be base on the risk
of adverse pregnancy outcome   increase accord to glycaemia   ogtt should be perform after
overnight fast   8 14 h    administer 75 g of
anhydrous glucose in 250 300 ml water   1   
for the first time in 2011 american diabete
association   ada   recommend that all pregnant
woman with no prior diabetes should undergo a

226
 
75 g ogtt at 24 28 week of gestation   a single abnormal value be sufficient to make diagnosis
  6    the world health organization   who    diagnostic criterion and classification of hyperglycemia
first detect in pregnancy   establish that gestational diabetes mellitus should be diagnose at
any time in pregnancy if one or more of the
follow criterion be meet after a 75 g ogtt   fast plasma glucose 5 1 6 9 mmol l   92 125 mg dl   
1 hour plasma glucose    10 0 mmol l   180 mg dl  
follow a 75 g oral glucose load   2 hour plasma
glucose    8 5 11 0 mmol l   153 199 mg dl   follow a 75 g oral glucose load   1    the national institute
for health and care excellence   nice   guideline
suggest offer self monitoring of blood glucose
or a 75 g 2 hour ogtt as soon as possible during
the first trimester for woman with a history of gestational diabete   if negative   it should be repeat
at 16 and 24 28 week of gestation   49    moreover   a 75 g ogtt at 24 28 week be recommend
to woman with one of the follow risk factor  
bmi above 30 kg m 2   previous macrosomic baby
weigh 4 5 kg or above   family history of diabetes  
minority ethnic family origin with high prevalence of
diabete   49   
figo guideline encourage test all pregnant
woman use a one step procedure and follow the
who criteria   though   alternative strategy should
be use accord to available resource for low
income country   13    the american college of
obstetrician and gynecologist   acog    on the
other hand   support the two step process   as evidence

in early pregnancy   the non pregnancy recommend
screen test   fast plasma glucose or hba1c

screen criterion  
the use of non pregnant criterion could lead to

dietary modification   exercise and glucose monitoring be the first line of treatment for gdm   40    it be
estimate that 70 90    of woman with gdm could
be manage with lifestyle approach alone   6   12    all
woman at risk for or diagnose with gdm should
be assess and counsel by a dietitian when possible   5    the optimal dietary composition to improve
perinatal outcome be unknown   40    carbohydrate
moderation be usually recommend   and the daily
carbohydrate intake should be distribute in five or
six meal   3 moderate size meal and 2 or more
snack    5   40    complex carbohydrate be to be
prefer over simple carbohydrate to avoid significant postprandial hyperglycemia and to reduce
insulin resistance   40    current evidence   although
limit   support the use of low glycemic index diet
in woman with gdm   5   91   97    the optimal calorie intake for woman with gdm be not define   12   
therefore   a nutrition assessment should be base
on the dietary reference intake that recommend a
minimum of 175 g of carbohydrate   71 g of protein
and 28 g of fiber per day for all pregnant woman
  5   12    woman with gdm be at risk to develop
starvation ketosis in an effort to control blood glucose level   5    ketonemia should be test in pregnant
woman with gdm present with hyperglycemia to
exclude diabetic ketoacidosis   49    mild impact exercise should be recommend as part of the treatment
plan for woman with gdm   even if no randomize
trial prove its benefit   5   40    nice recommend
regular exercise such as walk for 30 minute after
a meal   49    further study be need to enable
the prescription of evidence base specific physical
activity intervention   91    bmi   weight gain during pregnancy and glycemic control can influence
fetal growth but it seem to be independent risk factor   98    avoid excessive weight gain can reduce
the risk of macrosomia   on the other hand   maternal weight loss during pregnancy or poor weight gain
be associate to increase incidence of sga   98   
no evidence about weight gain or loss in woman
with gdm be available   5   98    therefore they should
follow the institute of medicine   iom   guideline for
weight gain in pregnancy until new recommendation

metformin be deem a well choice than glyburide  
insulin should be the first line therapy in woman
with gdm at high risk of fail on oral therapy  
such as patient diagnose with gdm at less than
20 week of gestation or with fast plasma glucose level above 110 mg dl or 1 hour post prandial
glucose above 140 mg dl or pregnancy weight gain
great than 12 kg   13   
in addition to the treatment with oral antidiabetic
agent or insulin   the effectiveness of novel treatment agent for gdm such as myo inositol have be
investigate in recent year   more specifically   dietary
supplementation with myo inositol during pregnancy
have prove to be effective not only in prevention
but also in the treatment of gdm   in this regard  
pintaudi et al   evaluate the effect of myo inositol
supplementation on glucose variability in a group of
12 pregnant woman with gdm   find a significant reduction of glucose variability in these woman
  102    also the study by fraticelli et al   show the
positive effect of the supplementation with inositol stereoisomer on insulin resistance level and
several maternal fetal outcome in woman affect
from gdm   103    however   despite several study highlight the positive outcome of myo inositol
supplementation in woman with gdm   104 106   
there be still no solid scientific evidence to support
its use for the treatment of gestational diabetes   107   
for this reason   further clinical trial be need in
order to well investigate the optimal dose   frequency
and timing of supplementation   as well as to report
adverse effect and long term effect of this treatment

for patient unable to safely administer insulin   40   
nice suggest metformin as first line therapy for
woman with gdm and insulin as an alternative when
metformin be contraindicate or unacceptable to the
woman   49    insulin should be add to diet   exercise and metformin if blood glucose target be not
meet   49    insulin with or without metformin should
be reserve to woman with gdm and fast plasma

8   conclusion
currently   gdm be a real health emergency because
its incidence be constantly increase with a high
risk of fetal morbidity and mortality   both during
the pregnancy and in the postnatal period   furthermore   woman affect by gdm and their offspring
have an increase risk of develop diabetes mellitus and metabolic dysfunction in the course of
life   for these reason   it be important to promote
an adequate prevention of gdm   especially through
lifestyle intervention such as diet and physical activity   moreover   novel non pharmacologic agent such
as myo inositol seem to be effective and safe both in
the prevention and the treatment of gdm   however  
further study be need in order to well define
the most appropriate strategy for the clinical man

there be now strong evidence that lifestyle modification can prevent or delay the
development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in high risk individual   woman with gestational
diabetes mellitus be at increase risk for type 2 diabetes and so be candidate for
prevention program   we review literature on type 2 diabetes risk in woman with
gestational diabetes   examine current recommendation for postpartum and long term
follow up   and summarize finding from a 2007 expert panel meeting   we find datum to
support that woman with gestational diabete have an increase in risk of type 2 diabetes
comparable in magnitude with that of individual with impair glucose tolerance and or
impair fasting glucose and that prevention intervention likely be effective in this
population   current recommendation from lead organization on follow up of woman
after delivery be conflict and compliance be poor   clinician and public health worker

this issue be especially important because screen for ifg and igt in
asymptomatic individual be not currently recommend as part of routine
clinical care 18 because of the urgency of
the grow diabetes epidemic   it be not
practical to require that prevention trial
be conduct in all high risk group before expand prevention recommendation beyond individual with ifg  
igt   therefore   it be important to
identify other high risk group that
likely will benefit from prevention intervention 17 because woman with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus
  gdm   be at elevated risk for type 2 diabetes   they represent 1 such high risk
group  
gestational diabete   define as carbohydrate intolerance lead to hyperglycemia with onset or first recognition

this carbohydrate intolerance usually resolve after delivery 20 21 up to one third

important information about future risk
for diabetes that can be use to identify
individual need ongoing monitoring
and prevention intervention  
we review literature on type 2 diabetes risk in woman with a history of
gdm   summarize current recommendation for postpartum and long term
follow up   and review progress toward implementation of those recommendation   we then summarize recommendation and research gap base

so may be more beneficial than fpg   in
counsel for future pregnancy   
however   acog further note that the
benefit of postpartum screening be unproven 42 a conclusion that be consistent
with the 2002 us preventive service
task force recommendation for the
general population   which state that insufficient evidence exist to recommend
for or against screen asymptomatic

international workshop panel explicitly
recommend that woman who have
gdm but do not have diabete immediately postpartum should receive an
ogtt 6 to 12 week postpartum and
consider a fast plasma glucose level
insufficiently sensitive to identify
woman with diabete or igt 45

have a low short term risk for type 2
diabete compare with woman who
have ifg or igt at the postpartum
screen   but likely still have an elevated
long term risk compare with woman
who do not have gdm   the few exist
we base study of long term risk for
type 2 diabetes that have separately examine woman who have normal glycemia after delivery be limit by the duration of follow up   which may be too
short   for example   in a large cohort of
hispanic woman with prior gdm 34
woman be analyze accord to the
area under the glucose tolerance curve of
their postpartum ogtt   those who fall
into the second or first quartile have normal glucose tolerance   however   their 5
year cumulative incidence rate of diabete be 27   and 12    respectively   although these rate be low than the rate
of 84   for woman in the fourth quartile
  all of whom have igt    they be high
than an 8 year cumulative incidence rate
of 3   in a separate study of mexican
american adult with normal glucose
tolerance at baseline 34 62
additional study be need to far assess diabete risk in woman who
do not have ifg or igt at postpartum
screen  
it be difficult to determine from exist study whether diabete prevention
intervention be effective in woman
with a history of gdm but normal postpartum glucose tolerance   most intervention trial conduct thus far have
not include individual with normal
glycemia   and duration of follow up in
exist study may be too short   give
the low risk in this group   for example  
in the tripod study   woman be follow up for a median duration of 30
month   woman with normal glucose
tolerance at baseline be not exclude  
but the incidence of diabete in these
woman be low   precluding meaningful
analysis of the effect of treatment in this
group 8
likewise   in the xenical in the prevention of diabete in obese subject study  
orlistat plus a lifestyle intervention significantly reduce the risk of diabetes

alone   in subject with igt at baseline  
but a protective effect be not discern

ible in the subgroup of obese adult with
normal glucose tolerance at baseline  
the latter finding be perhaps because individual with normal glucose tolerance
be at relatively low risk for diabetes  
and the study do not have adequate
power to detect a protective effect in the
relatively short follow up period 14 additional research be need to determine
the efficacy of diabetes prevention intervention in woman with normal glycemia at their postpartum assessment  
the major organization previously
discuss have address diabetes prevention for woman with a history of
gdm   table 1    recommendation
from the fifth international workshop
state that provider and researcher
should   support public health initiative
such as        the national diabetes education and prevention for gdm initiative
for implementation of the diabetes prevention lifestyle program into the public
sector   45 the ada recommend that all
woman with a history of gdm should be
educate about lifestyle modification  
whereas those with ifg or igt at postpartum screening should receive intense
medical nutrition therapy and an individualized exercise program 43 the
acog state that woman with additional risk factor   such as early onset
gdm or obesity   should receive counseling regard diet   exercise   and
weight management to prevent or delay
type 2 diabetes 42
however   evidence suggest that help woman manage their weight and increase their physical activity during the
postpartum period will be challenge  
previous trial evaluate education   goal
set   counseling   and follow up by
telephone or mail but have high attrition
rate   and participant achieve only
modest success in reach their
goal 63 65 furthermore   because woman
of reproductive age may seek care from
different type of provider over time  
there be no clear mechanism to ensure
they receive appropriate follow up  
finally   previous randomize trial of
lifestyle intervention to prevent diabete often have use intensive intervention with multiple counseling session
and multiple year of follow up   compliance with this type of intervention may
 
clinical opinion
 
be particularly difficult for woman with
infant or young child   therefore   intervention previously use in diabetes
prevention trial may need to be modify to produce meaningful improvement in future diabetes risk among
woman with a recent history of gdm  
 
comment
in the united states   antepartum screen for gdm be nearly universal 51 66 offer an opportunity for type 2 diabetes
risk assessment that be far reach  
screen for gdm may identify up to
31   of parous woman who will later develop type 2 diabetes67 and have the potential add advantage of identify atrisk woman before they develop
abnormal glycemia in the nonpregnant
state   provide an opportunity for prevention early in the process of beta cell
decline  
the potential public health impact of
achieve universal postpartum screening be also substantial   in the united
state   there be approximately 4 million
live birth each year   if gdm affect 5  
of pregnancy   200 000 per year    postpartum screening could identify approximately 8000 woman with exist type 2
diabete and 30 000 with ifg or igt
who might benefit from prevention intervention   an additional 162 000
woman with normal postpartum screen result could receive education about
lifestyle modification   from an expert
panel meeting convene by the cdc in
april 2007   the follow recommendation and research gap be identify

normal fasting glucose and glucose tolerance at their postpartum visit should
receive   at a minimum   education about
the benefit of weight management and
increase physical activity   woman with
a history of gdm but a clinical picture
that be inconsistent with elevated risk for
type 2 diabetes   such as lean body habitus and absence of a family history of
type 2 diabetes   may benefit from referral to a specialist for further evaluation  
all woman with a gdm affect pregnancy should be educate about the importance of monitor their glucose

treat type 2 diabetes  
 
research gap
research be need to determine how to
maximize patient and provider compliance with recommendation for postpartum screen   in particular   study
be need to determine whether the increase sensitivity of the ogtt   compare with a fpg   be offset by a potential
reduction in compliance 68 in addition  
the optimal type and frequency of
screen after the postpartum period
have not be establish  
the degree to which the risk of type 2
diabetes be elevate in woman with normal glycemia in the postpartum period be
uncertain   research be need to quantify the potential benefit of lifestyle
modification and or pharmacotherapy
in this population   researcher may
need to consider study design use intermediate outcome   such as rise glucose level or conversion to ifg or igt  
rather than diabete  
it be unknown whether and how lifestyle modification intervention use in
previous diabetes prevention trial
should be modify for woman with a recent pregnancy   study of diabetes prevention intervention for this population should address how to maximize
compliance in this population of woman
who may be overwhelm by the demand of motherhood  
the long term safety and efficacy of
pharmacotherapy for diabetes prevention among woman with a history of
gdm have not be establish   future
study should include in their design

consideration of the relatively young age
and the likelihood of future pregnancy
in this population  
in conclusion   screen pregnant
woman for gdm offer health care provider a unique opportunity to identify
individual at high risk for type 2 diabete who be candidate for early treatment and prevention intervention  
identify high risk individual early
allow prevention intervention to begin
soon in the process of beta cell decline
than would otherwise be possible in the
absence of universal screening  
health care provider and public
health worker face numerous challenge in develop and implement
an intervention for this population   and
it be likely that meaningful reduction in
risk will require a multilevel approach
that include patient and provider education   development of efficient mechanism for the transfer of medical information among provider   establishment
of readily available intervention   and
environmental change that support
physical activity and healthy eating  
translation research will be critical in
address this important public health
issue

combine diet and exercise in pregnancy for prevent gestational diabetes mellitus
review question
what be the effect of combine diet and exercise for prevent gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm    and related health problem for
mother and their baby   this be an update of a cochrane review that be first publish in 2015  
background
gdm be high blood sugar   hyperglycaemia   during pregnancy   up to a quarter of pregnant woman develop gdm   with some at a high risk
than other   such as overweight or obese woman   old woman   and those of particular ethnicity    gdm can lead to significant health
problem for woman and their baby   in the short term   woman with gdm may develop pre eclampsia   high blood pressure   hypertension  
and protein in the urine    or give birth by caesarean section   their baby may grow large for their gestational age   and   as a result   be injure
at birth   and or cause injury to their mother during birth   baby of mother with gdm often have low blood glucose   hypoglycaemia   and
be overweight   later in life   health problem such as neurosensory disability and type 2 diabetes can develop in these baby   eat
well and exercise be know to prevent type 2 diabetes and may be effective for prevent gdm  
study characteristic
we search for evidence in november 2016 and include 23 randomise control trial   rct    involve 8918 woman and their 8709
baby    most study be undertake in high income country   all of the study compare woman receive diet and exercise program
with woman receive standard care without diet and exercise program   the study vary in the diet and exercise program evaluate
and health outcome report   none report receive funding from a drug manufacturer or agency with interest in the result

key result
finding from 19 study   6633 woman   show a possible reduction in gdm in woman who receive diet and exercise program compare
with woman who receive standard care   fourteen study   6089 woman   show a possible reduction in caesarean birth   14 study   6089
woman   and 16 study   5052 woman   show low weight gain during pregnancy in woman who receive exercise program   we find
no difference between group in other health problem for   pre eclampsia   8 study   5366 woman    high blood pressure   6 study   3073
woman    a large for age baby at birth   11 study   5353 baby    and perineal trauma   2 study   2733 woman    death of baby around birth
  2 study   3757 baby    the baby have low blood glucose after birth   2 study   3653 baby    and infant be overweight   2 study  
794 infant   do not differ in the two group   effect on depression or type 2 diabetes for mother   a combine outcome of death or illhealth for baby   or type 2 diabetes or neurosensory disability for baby as child be not report   participant view of program
be examine  
the evidence suggest combined diet and exercise program may be effective for prevent gdm though the optimum component of
these program be not yet clear   future study could describe the intervention use in more detail   if and how these influence behaviour
change and ideally be standardise between study   study could also consider measure similar maternal and infant outcome and
report they in a standardised way  
quality of the evidence
the overall risk of bias be judge unclear due to lack of information on method   we assess evidence quality use grade
consideration for select key outcome   our assessment range from moderate to very low

background
description of the condition
introduction and definition
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be define as carbohydrate
intolerance result in hyperglycaemia   abnormally high blood
sugar   of variable severity with onset or first recognition during
pregnancy   who 1999    gdm define in this way include woman
with undiagnosed pre exist diabete   as well as those for whom
the first onset be during pregnancy   especially during the third
trimester of pregnancy   
pathophysiology and symptom
in normal pregnancy   relative maternal insulin resistance develop  
begin in the second trimester   with a progressive decline in
insulin sensitivity until term   this physiological change facilitate
the transport of glucose across the placenta to stimulate
normal fetal growth and development   for woman with gdm  
a great degree of maternal insulin resistance may lead to
maternal hyperglycaemia   increase glucose transport across the
placenta   fetal hyperinsulinaemia and accelerate growth in the
fetus   setji 2005    usually   pregnancy induce maternal insulin
resistance resolve promptly after the baby be bear   while many
woman be asymptomatic   symptom and sign associate with
hyperglycaemia   such as polyuria   increase urinary frequency   
polydipsia   increase thirst    blur vision and fatigue   may be
see where gdm be undetected or poorly control   kjos 1999   
risk factor for gdm

in the absence of any know pregnancy or medical complication
  acog 2015   nice 2017    woman often reduce their level of

how the intervention might work
combine diet and exercise intervention
while diet and exercise intervention alone and separately for the
prevention of type 2 diabetes and gdm have be widely assess  
more recently there have be a shift towards combine such
intervention in what may be regard as   lifestyle   intervention  
several randomise control trial have establish that the
progression to type 2 diabetes can be prevent or postpone
with lifestyle intervention in individual with impaired glucose
tolerance in the general population    high risk   individual  
  knowler 2002   li 2008   ratner 2008   tuomilehto 2001    such
study have focus strongly on combine increase physical
activity and dietary modification   along with weight reduction
for overweight participant   long term follow up study of such
lifestyle intervention   that last for a limited time    have show
sustain beneficial effect on risk factor and diabete incidence
  tuomilehto 2011    it have be suggest that a key factor in
the success of such intervention be the comprehensive approach  
address and work to correct several lifestyle relate risk
factor simultaneously   tuomilehto 2011   
 
cochrane database of systematic review
 
as it be accept that a multitude of risk factor may increase
the risk of type 2 diabetes   these randomise trial focus on
a number of lifestyle relate factor concurrently   in a finnish
diabetes prevention study   five lifestyle target be predefine  
include   weight loss great than 5    intake of fat low than
30   energy   intake of saturate fat low than 10   energy   intake
of dietary fibre great than 15 g 1000 kcal   and an increase of
physical activity to at least four hour per week   tuomilehto 2001   
these target be perceive as relatively modest   and it be
believe that such lifestyle change would be feasible to maintain
in the long term   tuomilehto 2011    no   high risk   individual with
impair glucose tolerance develop diabete during the trial if
they achieve at least four of the five lifestyle target   tuomilehto
2001    this trial be the first of a number to show that type
2 diabetes may be prevent with lifestyle intervention   and
highlight the importance of address multiple lifestyle relate
risk factor for optimal benefit   knowler 2002   li 2008   tuomilehto
2001   
whilst such trial consider type 2 diabetes and do not focus
on pregnant woman   they do offer some support for the use
of lifestyle intervention in pregnant woman for the prevention
of gdm   to date   the cochrane review assess dietary advice
alone and exercise intervention alone   for gdm prevention   have
reveal inconclusive finding   han 2012   tieu 2017    the review
  dietary advice in pregnancy for prevent gestational diabetes
mellitus    tieu 2017   include 11 trial   and conclude that while
very low quality evidence suggest a possible reduction in gdm
risk for woman receive dietary advice versus standard care  
far high quality evidence be need to determine the effect of
dietary advice intervention in pregnancy   tieu 2017    the review
  exercise for pregnant woman for prevent gestational diabetes
mellitus    han 2012    include five trial   and conclude that there
be no clear evidence to support a reduction in gdm risk for
woman receive an exercise intervention versus standard care  
and highlight a need for further high quality evidence   han
2012   
as it be widely acknowledge that many factor be associate with
gdm risk   it be consider plausible that lifestyle intervention  
aim at address lifestyle relate risk factor   may be effective
in prevent gdm   such lifestyle intervention may combine diet
intervention with exercise intervention  
 
why it be important to do this review
gdm be associate with a wide range of adverse health
consequence for woman and their baby in the short and long
term   effective strategy be thus require to prevent gdm and
the associated complication   this review will complement the
exist review title   dietary advice in pregnancy for prevent
gestational diabetes mellitus    tieu 2017   and   exercise for pregnant
woman for prevent gestational diabetes mellitus    han 2012    and
will assess combine diet and exercise intervention for prevent
gdm   this be an update of the review which be first publish in

cluster randomise trial
 
datum synthesis
 
we include cluster randomise trial in the analysis along with
individually randomise trial   we adjust their sample size and
event rate use the method describe in the cochrane handbook
for systematic review of intervention   higgin 2011    use an
estimate of the intracluster correlation co efficient   icc   of 0 12
derive from an include trial   luoto 2011    we consider it
reasonable to combine the result from the cluster randomise
trial and the individually randomise trial as there be little
heterogeneity between the trial design and the interaction
between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation
unit be consider to be unlikely  
 
we carry out statistical analysis use review manager software
  revman 2014    we use fix effect meta analysis for combine
datum where it be reasonable to assume that trial be estimate
the same underlying treatment effect   I e   where trial be
examine the same intervention   and the trial   population
and method be judge sufficiently similar   where there be
clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlie
treatment effect differ between trial   or where substantial
statistical heterogeneity be detect   we use random effect
meta analysis to produce an overall summary if an average
treatment effect across trial be consider clinically meaningful  
the random effect summary be treat as the average of the
range of possible treatment effect and we have discuss the
clinical implication of treatment effect differ between trial  
if the average treatment effect be not clinically meaningful   we
would not have combine trial  
 
we acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and
perform a subgroup analysis to investigate the effect of the
randomisation unit  
cross over trial
we consider cross over design inappropriate for this research
question  
 
where we have use random effect analyse   the result have
be present as the average treatment effect with 95  
confidence interval   and the estimate of tau2 and i2  
 
multi arm trial
in future update of this review   if we include multi arm trial  
we plan to use method as describe in the cochrane handbook

overall completeness and applicability of evidence
the evidence for combine diet and exercise intervention during
pregnancy for gdm prevention be incomplete   though we be
able to include 23 trial involve almost 9000 woman   assess
a wide range of combine diet and exercise intervention   many
of these trial report on few review outcome   all include trial
compare the intervention with standard or routine care   and thus
we be not able to consider comparison of different type of
combine diet and exercise intervention  
in regard to review outcome select for quality assessment

no include trial provide datum  
for many of our other secondary review outcome   include

of healthcare service    evidence be limit to datum from one
or two trial   though include trial have now provide some
  limit   datum on childhood health and maternal health in the
postpartum period   for the majority of review outcome relate
to long term health for the mother and their infant in childhood
and adulthood   there be no data   thus   there remain a paucity
of evidence regard the effect of these intervention during
pregnancy on long term health   far   there be limited datum
provide from include trial in regard to adherence   woman s
sense of well be   quality of life and their view   reporting of
outcome such as relevant biomarker and behaviour change
associate with the intervention be not standardise   and varied
greatly   in include trial   restrict our ability to combine datum  
the ability to draw firm conclusion be far limit  
particularly   by notable variation in the characteristic of the
 
cochrane database of systematic review
 
intervention assess   consider the feature of both the diet
and exercise component   and woman include in the trial   while
we choose to combine trial in one comparison   and attempt
to explore variation through subgroup analyse   the ability to do
this be limit by the difficulty in meaningfully group trial
accord to important characteristic   in regard to applicability  
of the 23 include trial   all except one be conduct in
upper middle or high income country   this likely limit the
generalisability of the finding to other country   particularly
low resource setting   far   the include trial use specific
and vary screen diagnostic test   diagnostic criterion   and
subsequent management strategy for gdm   which may limit both
the interpretation of datum   and also   the applicability of the result
for country setting use different approach   and with vary
practicability and feasibility consideration  
 
quality of the evidence
risk of bias of the 23 include trial be mixed   dodd 2014  
the large trial   involve 2212 woman and their infant   be
consider to be at low risk of bias overall   across the include
trial   there be a general lack of methodological detail provide
to assess specific aspect of risk of bias   lead to many   unclear  
judgement   we be able to include 12 of the 23 trial   judge
to be at low risk of selection bias   in sensitivity analysis   which
largely support finding from the main analysis   with dodd 2014
contribute between approximately 20   and 66   of the weight to

potential bias in the review process
the search for trial in this area be perform use cochrane
pregnancy and childbirth s trial register   it be unlikely that trial
that have be conduct have be miss   however unpublished
trial   or ongoing trial not register in clinical trial registry could
be miss   should such trial be identify   we will include they in
future update of the review  
we explore the potential for publication bias use funnel

gestational weight gain   gestational weight gain above the
iom recommendation   gestational age at birth   preterm birth  
macrosomia   and birthweight    and there be no clear indication of
asymmetry except in the case of gestational weight gain  
we aim to reduce bias wherever possible by have at least

review
two cochrane review have assess diet intervention   tieu 2017  
and exercise intervention   han 2012   for gdm prevention   tieu
2017 include 11 trial involve 2786 woman and their infant  
six of which compare diet intervention with standard care  
similar to our review   a reduction in gdm be observe for woman
receive diet intervention compare with standard care   very lowquality evidence    however unlike our review   a subgroup analysis
suggest a great treatment effect for overweight and obese
woman   tieu 2017    tieu 2017 also find less gestational weight
gain among woman who receive diet intervention compare
with standard care   low quality evidence    han 2012 include five

intervention compare with standard care   unlike our review   no
clear impact of exercise intervention on gdm be show   quality
of evidence not assess    han 2012    both review conclude that
additional high quality evidence be require   han 2012   tieu 2017   
a further cochrane review have assess diet intervention  
exercise intervention   or combine diet and exercise intervention
for prevent excessive gestational weight gain in pregnancy
  muktabhant 2015    muktabhant 2015 include 65 trial   of which
49 involve 11 444 woman and their infant contribute datum   most
of which compare such intervention with standard care   as in
our review   diet or exercise   or both   intervention be show to
reduce excessive gestational weight gain   high quality evidence   
and lead to low gestational weight gain compare with standard
care   moderate quality evidence    muktabhant 2015    unlike our
review   a reduction in maternal hypertension   low quality evidence  
be observe   and no clear difference in preterm birth   moderatequality evidence   or macrosomia   high quality evidence   be
observe   as be see in our review   in a subgroup analysis by
risk   however   high risk woman who receive combined diet and
exercise intervention have a low risk of macrosomia   moderatequality evidence    and their infant have a low risk of respiratory
distress syndrome   moderate quality evidence    muktabhant 2015   
as we observe   muktabhant 2015 do not assess the impact of such
intervention on gdm   as it be the focus of our review   
numerous other systematic and non systematic review have
assess diet and or exercise intervention for reduce adverse
pregnancy outcome   include gdm   the review continue to
reveal inconsistent finding in regard to benefit   however much of
this variation be likely attributable to difference in group of woman
and type of intervention   and thus trial   include and assess  
for example   in regard to variation in type of intervention  
recently   song 2016 conduct a systematic review and metaanalysis assess the effect of diet and or exercise intervention
on the risk of gdm   the review include 29 trial involve 11 487
woman and overall show a reduction in gdm   song 2016    song
2016 thus conclude that lifestyle modification during pregnancy
can reduce the risk of gdm   however   when combine diet and
exercise   14 trial    diet alone   five trial    and exercise alone
  10 trial   intervention be consider separately   the observed
reduction in gdm be no long   statistically significant    although
the direction of effect for each type of intervention do suggest
benefit   song 2016    in regard to assessment of intervention
in different group of woman   o brien 2016   for example   show
no clear impact of diet and or lifestyle intervention on gdm
specifically in woman with a normal bmi   while madhuvrata 2015
 
cochrane database of systematic review
 
show a reduction in gdm with diet intervention   but not
exercise intervention or combine diet and exercise intervention  
specifically in woman with risk factor for gdm  
a recent individual participant datum   ipd   analysis of antenatal
diet and exercise intervention   rogozińska 2017   show some
similarity and some difference with our finding   in the overall
ipd   there be 36 study with 12 343 woman   last search in
march 2015    cover diet alone   exercise alone and mixed diet
and exercise intervention compare with standard care   the ipd
find no overall difference for gdm or preterm birth   in contrast to
our finding of a reduction in these two outcome   however   both
our review and the ipd find reduction in gestational weight gain
and caesarean section with lifestyle intervention   the ipd include
16 mixed diet and exercise study but note that 10 other mixed
diet and exercise study be not include   which may explain
difference in finding   our review include 23 study   
although evidence appear to be accumulate in favour of diet
and combine diet and exercise intervention for the prevention
of gdm   uncertainty remain   and further work be require to
disentangle specific effect in different group of woman   and with
different diet and exercise intervention characteristic  
 
author   conclusion
implication for practice
moderate quality evidence suggest reduce risk of gdm and
caesarean section with combine diet and exercise intervention
during pregnancy as well as reduction in gestational weight gain  
compare with standard care   there be no clear difference in
hypertensive disorder of pregnancy   perinatal mortality   large forgestational age   perineal trauma   neonatal hypoglycaemia   and
childhood adiposity   moderate   tovery low quality evidence   
due to the variability of the diet and exercise component test
in the include study   the evidence in this review have limit
ability to inform practice   future study need to describe the
intervention use in more detail   if and how these influence
behaviour change and ideally be standardise between study  
study could consider use exist core outcome set to facilitate
more standardised reporting  
 
implication for research
additional adequately power   well design randomise
control trial   address the limitation of previous study  
be need to assess the effect of combine diet and exercise
intervention compare with standard care   and far   to assess
the effect of different diet and exercise intervention  
it be important for future trial to consider collect and report
on important outcome such as those suggest in this review  
include short term and long term maternal and infant child  
adult outcome   and outcome relate to the use and cost of
health service   improve reporting of maternal characteristic
will enable further assessment of variation in intervention effect  
such as base on baseline risk for gdm   enhance reporting   and
exploration of the effect of specific characteristic of the diet and
exercise intervention   be require   the datum in the current review
be complicate by factor such as differ diagnostic criterion for
gdm   and varied outcome description and definition   these be
important issue for future trial to consider

gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be a form of diabetes
first diagnose during pregnancy   usually between 24 and
28 week   currently   management for woman with gdm
consist of medical nutrition therapy with adjunctive
exercise for at least 30 minute day   patient who fail to
maintain glycemic goal through diet and exercise therapy
be give insulin injection   several epidemiological study have suggest a robust link between physical activity
and reduce risk of gdm   however   researcher have
be unable to suggest a cost effective   easily accessible  
evidence base program with guideline for frequency  
intensity   duration   and type of activity to prevent the
incidence of gdm in sedentary   at risk population   true
effectiveness of specific structured exercise program
remain untapped in gdm prevention and treatment and
many well control exercise study be warrant  
 
introduction
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be define as a
form of diabetes first diagnose during pregnancy   1 2   
during a normal pregnancy   a series of hormonal event
contribute to insulin resistance at the muscle level   the
insulin resistance decrease the blood glucose uptake by
the muscle   elevate maternal blood glucose to ensure an
adequate glucose supply for fetal growth and development
  3    however   this pregnancy induce insulin resistance
may unmask the onset of β cell dysfunction that underlie gdm   4      especially if risk factor for gdm be
present   pregnancy may tip the balance of glucose insulin
regulation   and abnormally high maternal blood glucose
and insulin concentration may result   5    the cause of
 
gdm be unknown   and may be a combination of genetic
and lifestyle   lead to pancreatic β cell defect   4     
there be modifiable and unmodifiable risk factor for
develop gdm   5    the modifiable risk factor include
physical inactivity or a sedentary lifestyle   obesity and
overweight with a bmi 25 kg m 2 or great   gdm in a
previous pregnancy   and a history of large baby weigh more than 9 lbs   4000 g    6    unmodifiable risk factor
include a history of diabetes in the immediate family   ethnicity   from aboriginal   hispanic   south asian   asian or
african descent    and maternal age     35 year    5 7 8   
up to 60   of woman with gdm will develop type 2
diabete within 4 year after delivery   9    the more pregnancy that culminate in gdm   the more a woman be at
risk for gdm in subsequent pregnancy   with a recurrence
of between 35   to 80    10    furthermore   the more gdm
pregnancy   the more she be at risk for diabetes later in life
  11    in addition   there be disease risk in the offspring bear
to gdm woman   these baby be more likely to develop
type 1 or 2 diabete later in life   1    also   large baby be at
risk for obesity   which be a risk factor for diabetes   12    and
the spiral cycle continue to escalate  
because in a low risk pregnancy the mother   placenta  
and fetus adapt physiologically to physical activity   which
improve maternal and fetal health   13 14    it may be possible that a minimal amount of physical activity during
pregnancy be necessary to maintain health   in fact   regular physical activity before pregnancy be associate with a
decrease in gdm risk   15     as illustrate in figure 1   a
baseline of physical conditioning should be maintain and
be necessary for health   if physical conditioning fall below
this threshold   alter maternal pregnancy adaptation that
put the mother and fetus at risk for disease may occur  
physical inactivity be a risk factor for obesity and
type 2 diabetes   both of which be at epidemic proportion in current society   10 16    obesity and gdm be
closely link   17    in that obese woman have a 17   risk
of develop gdm   16   and overweight woman with a
bmi of 25 to 30 kg m 2 have a 1 8 to 6 5 time great risk
of develop gdm than normal weight woman   16    in
addition   woman with gdm have a high risk for type 2
diabete later in life   16    to complete the link   one of the
 
 
382 special population
figure 1   diagram suggest that a
minimal amount of physical activity must
be maintain to achieve health benefit
during pregnancy   a sedentary lifestyle and  
thus   physical inactivity may put the mother
and fetus at risk for disease through altered

effect of gdm on the fetus
the high concentration of blood glucose in woman diagnose with gdm be make available to the fetus for growth
and development   excessive increase in birth size and
weight may lead to a difficult labor and delivery   especially
if the baby be great than 9 lbs   macrosomia    6    the
increase in body size be usually make up of excessive body
fat   with the baby bear lethargic and hypoglycemic   this
be due to the high concentration of circulate insulin produce by the fetus in response to the excess glucose pass
through the placenta into the fetal blood   once the umbilical cord be cut   the high maternal blood glucose supply end
abruptly   while the fetal pancreas continue to deliver high
concentration of insulin into the fetal circulation   this
cause hypoglycemia at birth   1    and   consequently   these
infant require an intravenous glucose supply   in addition  
fetal growth be disproportional   result in shoulder dystocia that can lead to difficult delivery through the birth
canal and often result in a cesarean section  
 
diagnosis of gdm
most pregnant woman in the united states and canada
be screen between 24 and 28 week of gestation   1 2   
the screening be a random test in which the woman be

conventional management of gdm
the primary management for woman with gdm be control
of energy intake   usually refer to as medical nutrition
therapy   mnt    as a dietary intervention   mnt have two
primary goal   to achieve normal glycemia through good
food choice   and to provide enough energy and nutrient
to meet the need of pregnancy   18    the dietary plan
suggest by a register dietitian usually include eat
small meal more often   more choice of complex carbohydrate with a low glycemic index   and the elimination
of high glycemic food   include carbonate beverage  
sweet   and cake   1    self capillary glucose monitoring
use a glucometer may be recommend up to seven time
per day   after 2 week of mnt   failure to control capillary glucose concentration will progress to management
of glycemia by insulin injection   target capillary glucose
concentration be list in table 2   it be imperative that
maternal blood glucose be maintain below these value  
either with mnt plus insulin injection or mnt and
lifestyle change   the course of insulin injection depend
on how well control the glucose concentration be
throughout the day   19    the type and amount of insulin
inject be beyond the scope of this article but depend on
medical intervention and management   4     
 
exercise as an adjunctive therapy for gdm
many health professional in canada and the united
state who counsel woman with gdm recommend that
patient increase their physical activity   the canadian
diabetes association   1   suggest that    physical activity
should be encourage   with the frequency   type   duration and intensity tailor to individual obstetric risk   
the american diabetes association   2   suggest that  
  woman without medical or obstetrical contraindication
be encourage to start or continue a program of moderate
exercise as part of treatment for gdm    the american
college of obstetrician and gynecologist   20   suggest
that    woman with gdm who lead an active lifestyle
should be encourage to continue a program of exercise

  from canadian diabetes association   1    american diabete
association   2    and metzg et al    4      
 
approve for pregnancy    the late recommendation
from the fifth international workshop conference on
gdm suggest    plan physical activity of 30 minute  
day be recommend    advise gdm patient to walk
briskly or do arm exercise while seat in a chair for at
least 10 minute after each meal accomplish this goal  
  4      however   because most current datum be base on
small study   exercise remain an adjunctive therapy  
evidence base study determine the frequency   intensity   time   and type of activity be need to provide the
well possible outcome for woman with gdm   however  
they have yet to be determine   when exercise be evaluate for control blood glucose concentration or for
delay or prevent insulin therapy   the result be
inconclusive   these mixed result could be due to the nonrandomization of the subject pool   small sample size   lack
of well control or report exercise intensity   limit
evaluation   only acute exercise be evaluate   no chronic
follow up be do    the difference in exercise modality   or questionable compliance to the exercise program  
a 6 week arm ergometry exercise program be
successful in normalize fast plasma glucose concentration and glycosylated hemoglobin   a1c   in gdm woman
randomize to diet therapy plus exercise compare with
diet therapy alone   21    the exercise program consist
of 20 minute of arm ergometry   three time per week   at
an intensity less than or equal to 50   maximum oxygen
consumption   vo2max    the result of this classic study
give rise to the recommendation of arm exercise for gdm
woman mention above   bung et al    22   randomize
gdm woman into a group with diet and insulin therapy
or diet and exercise   the exercise program consist of
stationary cycle ergometry   50   vo2max   for 45 minute
  three 15 minute bout with two rest    three time per
week   because no difference be find between group  
the author suggest that exercise may provide avoidance
of insulin therapy through an increase in insulin sensitivity   22    this be also suggest by garcia patterson et
al    23   in which light postprandial walk at 2 25 km h
increase heart rate by 9 beat per minute above rest
value   and decrease glucose excursion in gdm woman
  23    in another study   a single 30 minute bout of exercise
on a cycle ergometer at 35   or 55   of vo2max improve
 
 
384 special population
 
glucose excursion compare with rest in woman with
gdm   24    use a different exercise modality   brankston
et al    25   randomize gdm woman to a group with
diet alone or a group of diet plus circuit type resistance
train   the number of woman require insulin be not
different between group   however   in those woman who
be also overweight   a low incidence of insulin use
occur in the diet plus exercise group   25   
in contrast to the above study   less et al    26   determine the effect of a single bout of stationary cycling for
30 minute at 60   vo2max   compare six gdm woman
to five normal pregnant woman   the effect of a mixed
meal 14 hour after the exercise bout be examine and
no improvement in glucose excursion due to the exercise
be find in the gdm woman   26    in another study  
gdm woman be randomize to a partial home base
exercise program   70   of estimate heart rate maximum  
and compare with gdm woman with no structured exercise program   although the exercise program improve
the cardiorespiratory fitness of the gdm woman   glucose
excursion be not different compare with the woman
with no structured exercise program   27   
in a 2004 retrospective chart review from london  
canada assess conventional management of woman
diagnose with gdm   davenport et al    28   show that
by 30 week of pregnancy   62   of these woman   after
try conventional management for 2 week after diagnosis   require insulin therapy   of this cohort   woman
with a prepregnancy bmi of 25 kg m 2 or great be
2 6 time more likely to require insulin therapy than
those woman with a bmi below 25 kg m 2    the average
prepregnancy bmi of woman require insulin therapy
be 30 6    6 4 kg m 2   28    this high incidence of insulin therapy in woman with a bmi 25 kg m 2 or great
would indicate the need for an alternative therapy   in a
pilot study of woman with an early gdm diagnosis   at
16 to 20 week of gestation   who follow a structured
walk program   30   vo2peak   3 4 time per week  
in addition to conventional management   only 50  
require insulin therapy   28    although these be preliminary datum   it may be suggest that early diagnosis
in woman at risk for gdm   especially those woman with
a bmi    25 kg m 2   29    and the addition of a more intensive lifestyle intervention such as a structured mild
walk program to conventional management may
have promise result   more recently   artal et al    30   
randomize obese gdm woman into mnt plus exercise
  60   vo2max   or mnt alone   result show that the
mnt plus exercise group limit weight gain   decrease
macrosomia   and have no adverse pregnancy outcome
  30     the author conclude that place obese woman
with gdm on a lifestyle intervention strategy of weight
gain restriction may optimize pregnancy outcome and
impact future weight management behavior   future
lifestyle intervention program require further study to
confirm these promising result  
 
maternal physical activity to prevent gdm
in high risk group   gdm be consider a significant initiate factor in the type 2 diabetes epidemic   thus   gdm
prevention may lead to decrease rate of type 2 diabetes
in successive generation   31    woman who be the most
active before pregnancy   17    and also during pregnancy
  31   have the low prevalence of gdm   if gdm can be
prevent   overall rate of obesity and type 2 diabetes
in specific at risk population may be decrease   unfortunately   there be few study examine the effect of
exercise in prevent gdm incidence in at risk group
of woman   a pilot study examine the feasibility of use
exercise early     21 week gestation   in aboriginal woman
  32    compliance be minimal despite incentive and the
author report recruit only eight aboriginal woman
over 2 year   the exercise program may have be too
strenuous   as participant be require to exercise at
70   of age predict maximum   if this be a sedentary population group   the high exercise intensity may
have deter participation   with the small subject number   it be difficult to assess whether the program truly
prevent gdm   although the author suggest that
although only eight woman be recruit   the assessment
of the feasibility of early gdm diagnosis and intervention
be important   32   
dempsey et al    33   study pregnant woman who
participate in recreational exercise by use a selfreporte questionnaire on physical activity   they find
that woman who be the most active within the first 20
week of pregnancy have a 48   reduction in gdm   in
addition   woman who be the most active 1 year before
the index pregnancy have a 51   reduction in gdm risk  
when both variable be combine   the overall risk for
gdm be reduce by 60    the author conclude that
although the tool they use to measure physical activity
be imprecise   the relationship between physical activity
and reduction in gdm risk be robust   33   
mottola et al    34   investigate low risk pregnant
woman and show that mild exercise   30   vo2peak   on a
stationary bike be well at promote glucose tolerance in
response to an oral glucose load after exercise than moderate
intensity exercise   70   vo2peak   in late gestational woman  
biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle in these late pregnant
woman show that glut 4   glucose transporter sensitive
to insulin   be elevate in the mild exercise train woman
  start at 16 20 week gestation until delivery   compare with moderately train woman   35    subsequently  
when nutritional intake be control during pregnancy
  to    8350 kj day   with 200 g of carbohydrate day    the
combination of nutritional control and mild exercise   30  
vo2peak on stair climber   be well than mild exercise
alone in control blood glucose concentration and prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy   this effect
remain at 2 month postpartum   36    the above study
provide groundwork for development of a nutrition and
exercise lifestyle intervention program   nelip    in which
 
 
exercise in the prevention and treatment of gdm
 
a mild walking program   30   vo2peak   be combine with
nutritional control   8350 kj day   200 g carbohydrate day  
for woman at risk for gdm   37    preliminary result be
encourage   in that woman at risk for gdm do not develop
this disease while on nelip   n    23    excessive weight gain
be prevent   and normal glucose tolerance remain at 2
month postpartum   38    in addition   high risk woman on
nelip maintain an insulin sensitivity index similar to
those at low risk for gdm   and none develop gdm   39   
it be suggest that overweight woman at risk for gdm can
be give a nelip at 16 week of pregnancy to maintain insulin sensitivity and glucose excursion and to prevent excessive
weight gain and gdm   assessment of a1c in these woman
also show value well below the diabetic range   40     it
may be that mild exercise   regardless of modality   bike   stair
climber   or walk    be a key factor in combination with
nutritional control in help woman at risk for gdm
regulate blood glucose concentration and prevent excessive
weight gain during pregnancy   continue research be necessary in this important field  
 
conclusion
it be understandable why exercise have not be use successfully and consistently in the past for woman with
gdm   researcher have not be able to suggest a costeffective   easily accessible   evidence base program with
guideline for frequency   intensity   time   duration    and
type of activity   the f I t t   principle    41    that would produce the well possible outcome for woman with gdm  
although exercise be still consider a valuable adjunctive
therapy and preliminary result be encourage   the lack
of guideline from well control study mean the true
effectiveness of a specific structured exercise program in
control glucose excursion and reduce the incidence
of insulin therapy remain untapped   type 2 diabetes
and obesity be reach epidemic proportion in today s
society   if modifiable risk for develop diabete during
pregnancy such as prevent excessive weight gain and
preserve glucose tolerance can be reduce by incorporate lifestyle intervention   then this powerful tool may
be use throughout pregnancy to reduce the diabetes and
obesity epidemic in successive generation  
 
 
abstract
background    glucose intolerance during pregnancy predispose the offspring for increase risk of
develop glucose intolerance in the future   this vicious cycle be likely to influence and perpetuate the
incidence and prevalence of glucose intolerance in any population  
aim    no data be available about the prevalence of glucose intolerance during pregnancy in our country
and hence a study be undertake on this aspect  
method    this study be perform in the antenatal clinic of government maternity hospital   chennai  
india   as a pregnant woman in second or third trimester check into the antenatal clinic   she be give
50 gm oral glucose load and blood sample be collect after one hour   this test be perform on
1251 pregnant woman   they be request to come after 72 hour for the 75 gm ogtt recommend
by who   among the 1251 woman   891 respond   the blood sample be take in the fast state
and at 2 hour after 75 gm of oral glucose   diagnosis be base on the who criteria for gestational
diabete mellitus   gdm   
result    the mean age of these pregnant woman be 23    4 year   there be a significant increase in
the prevalence of gdm in relation to gravida   the effect of bmi do not quite reach statistical significance
  χ2   df 1     3 659   p    0 055    but a model of linear trend be significant  
of the 1251 woman who undergo the 50 gm oral glucose challenge test   670   53 55    have one hour
plasma glucose    130 mg dl   among the 891 pregnant woman who have 75 gms ogtt   168   18 9   
be diagnose as gdm   take both fpg    126 mg dl and or 2 hr ppg    140 mg dl as cut off value  
take only 2 hr plasma glucose for analysis   144   16 2    have a value    140 mg dl  
a similar study be conduct in different part of the country take only the 2 hr 75 gm post glucose
value of    140 mg dl as diagnostic criterion for gdm   of the total number of pregnant woman   n    3674  
screen   16 55   of they find to have gdm  
conclusion    our study have document the increase prevalence of gdm in our population
necessitate universal screening for glucose intolerance in pregnancy   use 2 hr plasma glucose    140
mg dl as a one step procedure be simple and economical   particularly for the country ethnically more
prone to high prevalence of diabetes

discussion
we believe that the way the study subject be
ascertain provide a representative and unbiased sample
of pregnant woman   as the bulk of the pregnant woman attend
hospital of this type for antenatal check up and confinement
in our country  
among 1251 pregnant woman screen with glucose
challenge   891 respond for 2 hr 75 gm ogtt   however  
neither positive family history nor parity influence the
report for the 75 gm 2 hr test   this phenomenon of no
show rate appear to be universal   magee et al report in
their follow up   91 of the 457 positive screen individual fail
to undergo diagnostic test 10 luiz et al also observe in their
study   that 23   of their screen positive woman do not return
for ogtt 11 our prevalence rate be 18 9    we get this figure
as we take into consideration for analysis the fpg value also
as this be available besides 2hr ppg   of the 891 woman   24
have fpg    126 mg dl   they might have have pregestational
diabete   we could not confirm this as a1c estimation be not
   japi    vol   52    september 2004
 
fig   3   prevalence percentage   with 95   confidence interval   of
gestational diabete by gravida   n   891   
 
recommend as routine test for screening and hence we
also do not perform the test 12 if our estimate prevalence
proportion among those positive and negative   respectively  
for the 50 gm 1hr test be apply to total sample of 1251
woman   the revise overall prevalence proportion would be
17 7    confidence limit   15 6   19 9    against the value of
18 9   find among the 891 woman   another outcome of this
study be that the fast plasma glucose estimation be not
necessary for universal screening as this procedure identify
negligible percentage of woman with glucose intolerance
  2 69     who be also not in favour of estimation of fpg for
screen 6
an overall prevalence proportion of gdm at 17 7   in this
rather young population of pregnant woman be
considerably high   subsequent to the observation of the high
prevalence of gdm in one centre   a multicentre study be
initiate in different part of the country in 2002    2003 take
only the 2 hr 75 gm post glucose value of    140 mg dl as
diagnostic criterion for gdm   almost a similar prevalence of
15   be obtain in another govt   maternity hospital
affiliate to madras medical college in the city of chennai  
this trend of high prevalence of gdm be also find in
other part of the country   15   in trivandrum   21   in alwaye  
12   in bangalore   18 8   in erode and 17 5   in ludhiana  
the total number of pregnant woman screen in these
centre be 3674 and an overall gdm prevalence of 16 55  
be observe   this study document a definite increase
trend in the prevalence of gdm compare to that of 2   in
198213 and 7 62   in 1991 14 this trend be also see in other
country   for example in australia at one hospital where the
same testing procedure and diagnostic criterion have be
use for more than 2 decade   the prevalence have more than
double 15
a recent national survey report the prevalence of igt
in the age group of 20 29 year and 30 39 year as 12 2   and
15 3   respectively 16 no gender difference be see in the
prevalence of igt 16 far for a give population and
ethnicity the risk of diabetes and pregnancy   mirror that of
the underlying frequency of type 2 dm in the general
population   17 we also observe in our study that the
prevalence of gdm be close if not similar to the prevalence

rate of igt in our population   with this huge population of
reproductive age in india   a significant segment of woman
with abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy need
cognizance  
our attempt and outcome of the screening for glucose
intolerance during pregnancy have give an insight for the
phenomenal increase in the prevalence of diabete in india  
this view be substantiate by the observation of dabelea et
al on pima indians   the gestational diabetes mellitus have a
far reach consequence in predispose the offspring to
glucose intolerance have be document in pima indians  
the child bear in 1965 to woman with gestational diabetes
be follow up till 2000   by the time they reach 35 year  
more than half of the group have diabete 3 hence as a policy
to identify gdm and its consequence on the infant a 75 gm
ogtt have be recommend to all woman in the population
during the third trimester of pregnancy 3
in india   both undernutrition and overnutrition exist during
pregnancy   there be two report study in india which be
relate to size at birth to future risk of type 2 diabetes   in
mysore   low birth weight do not increase the risk of diabetes
but baby who be short and fat   high body mass index  
bmi   at birth be at increase risk 18 fall et al speculate that
the rise in type 2 diabetes in indian urban population may
have be trigger by mild obesity in mother   lead to
glucose intolerance during pregnancy   macrosomic change
in the fetus and insulin deficiency in adult life 18 yet another
study by yajnik et al attribute high prevalence of type 2 dm
and igt in indian people may be link to poor fetal growth 19
same author also suggest that type 2 dm in india may be
program in fetal life   hence diabete prevention will have
to start in early life   in utero   and continue in later life 20 the
importance be that the intrauterine millieur interieur   whether
one of nutritional deprivation or one of nutritional plenty  
result in change in pancreatic development and peripheral
response to insulin that may lead to adult    onset gdm and
type 2 dm 21
our study favour one step procedure recommend by
who for screen instead of two step procedure use
preliminary screening with 50 gm one hr test   4 table 2 show
the result of the evaluation of the outcome of the 50 gm 1 hr
test   use the outcome of the 75 gm 2 hr test as standard  
the sensitivity of the 50 gm 1 hr test be 79 8   when
compare to the low specificity of 42 7    combine with a
relatively small number of false negative subject   this yield
reasonable high value of sensitivity   79 8    confidence limit  
72 7   85 4    and predictive value of a negative 50 gm 1 hr
test   90 1    confidence limit   86 3   92 9     however   there
be a substantial number of subject false positive for the 50

confidence limit   39 1   46 4    and predictive value of a
positive 50 gm 1 hr test   24 5    confidence limit   21 0 28 3     since the specificity of use 50 gm 1 hr test be low  
instead of perform screening test use 50 gm 1 hr test
and then 100 gm    75 gm ogtt4   a one step procedure of
perform 75gm ogtt directly be ideal as we need to perform
710
 
universal screen for glucose intolerance in pregnancy  
 
conclusion
in conclusion   our study have document the increase
prevalence of gdm in our population and we venture to give
the follow observation and recommendation   universal
screen for glucose intolerance during pregnancy be
essential as indian woman have high prevalence of diabetes
and their relative risk of develop gdm be 11 3 time
compare to white woman 22 asian woman be ethnically more
prone to develop glucose intolerance compare to other
ethnic group 15 gdm base on 2hr 75gm ogtt define by
who predict adverse pregnancy outcome and warrant
treatment 9 a 2 hr 75 gm post plasma glucose    140 mg dl
serve both as screening and diagnostic criterion besides be
a simple and economical one step procedure   as the routine
screen for glucose intolerance during pregnancy be not
do   probably the undiagnosed glucose intolerance that
have be occur in the past have result in the increase
prevalence of diabete in india   the timely action take now
in screen all pregnant woman for glucose intolerance  
achieve euglycemia in they and ensure adequate nutrition
may prevent in all probability   india become diabetes capital
of the world  
  no single period in human development provide a great
potential than pregnancy for long range pay off via relatively
short range period of enlighten metabolic manipulation   norbert frienkel

fifth international workshop conference on gdm
gdm and insulin resistance   two
form of insulin resistance exist in woman
who develop gdm   the first be the physiological insulin resistance of late pregnancy   evidence present suggest the
postreceptor mechanism that contribute
to the insulin resistance of normal pregnancy appear to be multifactorial   but be
exert in skeletal muscle at the    subunit of the insulin receptor and at the level
of insulin receptor substrate 1   in addition   increase free intracytoplasmic
p85   subunit of phosphatidylinositol
3 kinase appear to be involve   these alteration in insulin signal may contribute to reduced insulin mediate glucose
uptake in skeletal muscle   a major tissue
for whole body glucose disposal   insulin
resistance abate soon after pregnancy  
and the signal change have return
to normal within 1 year postpartum in
woman with normal glucose tolerance  
these finding suggest that the insulin resistance be drive by pregnancy induce
factor   with placental growth hormone
and tumor necrosis factor    currently be the most likely candidate  
the second form of insulin resistance
in gdm be a more chronic form that be
present before pregnancy and be exacerbate by the physiological change that
lead to insulin resistance during pregnancy   thus   most woman with gdm
have a combination of acquire and
chronic insulin resistance and be therefore   as a group   slightly more insulin resistant than normal woman during late
pregnancy   phosphorylation of insulin receptor tyrosine result in the transmission
of the insulin signal to enable glucose uptake   evidence present identify a significant decrease in maximal insulin
receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in
muscle as one potential mechanism for
the additional insulin resistance in obese
woman   evidence be also present for a
role of increase serine phosphorylation
of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1   competitively inhibit
insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine
phosphorylation and far inhibit
downstream insulin signal  
gdm and pancreatic    cell function  
compare with woman with normal glucose tolerance   those with gdm have
low insulin secretion for their degree of
insulin resistance   over the long term
  I e    year    insulin secretion deteriorate
in relation to chronic insulin resistance  
lead to progressive hyperglycemia and
predominantly type 2 diabetes   in a
latino population of woman with prior
s252
 
gdm   this deterioration have be slow
or arrest by treatment of insulin resistance   which take advantage of shortterm insulin sensitivity secretion change
to reduce insulin secretory demand on
   cell   in the diabetes prevention program   lifestyle intervention and therapy
with metformin also improve insulin
sensitivity and preserve    cell function
in woman with or without previous gdm  
whereas most woman who develop
gdm have evidence for    cell dysfunction relate to chronic insulin resistance  
an important minority do not   some of
these woman appear to have autoimmune
   cell dysfunction   evidence be present for the presence of cytoplasmic islet cell antibodie and antibody direct
against gad65   the membrane tyrosine
phosphatase   and insulin in some woman
with gdm   these autoantibody have
also be use to identify individual at
high risk for the development of autoimmune diabete in other setting   such as in
first degree relative of subject with classic type 1 diabetes   the frequency of such
autoimmunity tend to parallel the frequency of type 1 diabete in a give ethnic
group   these finding suggest that autoimmune    cell problem and relate
hyperglycemia represent a specific biological subtype of gdm that be distinct
from insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes   woman with this subtype of gdm
have clinical characteristic that be typically consider to impart a low risk of
gdm   lean   caucasian    autoimmune
gdm should be suspect in such patient   they may experience relatively
rapid metabolic deterioration during or
after pregnancy   so they require more aggressive follow up   no specific diseasemodifye therapy be currently
available for autoimmune gdm  
genetic of gdm   monogenic form of
diabete such as maturity onset diabetes
of the young   mody   autosomal dominant inheritance   and mitochondrial diabetes   maternal inheritance   often with
other clinical manifestation   appear to
contribute in a relatively minor way
   5   of case   to gdm   these condition
generally have a young age at onset and
relatively mild hyperglycemia   at least initially   so they may be detect by the routine glucose screening that be commonly
practice in pregnancy   the gene involve in these subtype of diabetes and
gdm appear to have important effect on
   cell function   and patient often do not
have evidence of chronic insulin resistance   clinical suspicion of these subtype
 
be base on lack of clinical evidence for
insulin resistance   couple with a suggestive family history   diagnosis require
genotype that have recently become
available for clinical practice  
the contribution of genetic to other
form of gdm be not well establish   the
sparse datum that be available suggest
modest heritability but be confound
by incomplete case ascertainment   nonetheless   the autoimmune and insulinresistant form of diabete outside of
pregnancy   disease for which gdm be often a precursor   be heritable   and some
contributory genetic variant have be
define   evidence be present that
some of the variant may contribute to
gdm or its physiological phenotype   insulin resistance     cell dysfunction    but
the study to date be relatively small   as
be the potential genetic contribution  
the placenta in gdm
the placenta serve as the primary interface between the mother and fetus   alteration in placental transport function can
modify the impact of maternal metabolic
abnormality of gdm on the develop
fetus   evidence present that be obtain from human term placenta study in vitro indicate that placental
glucose transport and metabolism be
normal in gdm pregnancy   despite increase glucose flux from mother to fetus that result from increase glucose
concentration on the maternal side  
transfer and metabolism of other maternal nutrient   e g    lipid   amino acid  
micronutrient   in gdm be not yet well
characterize   the placenta be a rich
source of steroid   lipid derive molecule   and peptide that can directly affect
maternal metabolism and fetal development   increase expression and production of cytokine such as tnf    
interleukin 6   and leptin by placenta
from woman with gdm could be relevant
to the development of exaggerated insulin
resistance in pregnancy complicate by
gdm   evidence be present that insulin from the fetus can modify placental
gene expression   glycogen deposition  
and vascular expansion   these finding
reveal a potential role of the fetus in regulate placental function but do not indicate whether fetal influence mitigate or
exaggerate the impact of gdm on fetal
development

epidemiology
current observation   in recent year  
there have be a global increase in the prevalence of both obesity and type 2 diabetes  
recent report provide convincing evidence
for an increase prevalence of gdm in the
u s   as well   multivariate analysis that be
review at the conference demonstrate
 
an increase in gdm within ethnic group as
well as an apparent disproportionate increase in the prevalence of gdm among
young   compare with old   pregnant
woman   determine whether   and to what
extent   a concurrent increase in prevalence
of gdm have occur globally be make difficult by a number of confounder include lack of uniformity in glucose tolerance
test   glucose load   glycemic threshold  
and number and timing of test result require to define gdm    another be the variation in the prevalence of gdm associate
with maternal age and ethnicity  
causal factor for the apparent increase in gdm be likely to be multiple  
include the prevalence of obesity   particularly in youth   due to low level of
physical activity and high level of caloric
intake   and improved survival of female
infant whose birth weight be at the
extreme of the normal range   as adult  
the latter individual have alter insulin
action and or insulin secretory capacity
that may predispose they to the development of gdm   birth weight history may
be a valuable aid in risk assessment for

perinatal implication
identification and intensive management of gdm be associate with a decrease in mortality and morbidity in
infant   with appropriate therapy   the
likelihood of intrauterine fetal death be
not detectably high than in the general population   morbidity can be increase   however   and this be likely to
remain an issue until optimal management of the alter intrauterine environment be understand and appropriate
intervention be implement  
excessive fetal growth remain an important perinatal concern in gdm   maternal hyperglycemia continue to be view
as the primary determinant of increase
fetal growth via delivery of glucose to the
fetus   which lead to fetal hyperinsulinemia   other factor influence growth
include nutrient such as amino acid and
lipid   specific growth factor   placental

ⱖ4 000 4 250 4 500 g   be great when
gdm be not recognize or be treat casually   consequence of excessive fetal
growth include birth trauma   maternal
morbidity from operative delivery   and
possible lifelong increase risk of glucose intolerance and obesity in the offspring   the cesarean delivery rate be
increase in patient with gdm   in part to
avoid birth trauma   some report suggest
that overtreatment of gdm result in
sustained level of glucose that be below
the normal range may lead to small forgestational age infant   variously define
as   10th or   5th percentile of birth
weight for gestational age and sex   
other neonatal morbidity that potentially occur more frequently in infant
of woman with gdm include hypoglycemia   hyperbilirubinemia   hypocalcemia  
erythremia   and poor feeding   prevalence
and severity of morbidity depend on

ultrasound measurement of fetal abdominal circumference   assess the
fetal response to maternal gdm by ultrasound measurement of fetal abdominal circumference start in the second

decision   evidence review at the
conference from randomized control
trial indicate that modification of metabolic management base on fetal
growth measurement may improve
perinatal outcome or at least be equivalent to standard intensify management   less intensify management may
be allow with normal growth   fetal
abdominal circumference   75th percentile for gestational age    although the
consensus be that some smbg should

macrosomia in current use be probably
now obsolete   and some measure of adiposity at birth may be more appropriate  
size at birth be a complex interaction between maternal environment and fetal
gene   a major component of maternal

minority of gps and specialist have joint followup protocol
 
introduction
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be
carbohydrate intolerance first recognise in
pregnancy 1 gdm affect approximately
3 5   of pregnancy in england and wale 2
follow pregnancy   woman with gdm
may have ongoing diabete and have
increase risk of develop impaired
glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes  
estimate of the risk of develop type 2
diabete after gdm vary from 2   to 70   
reflect difference in the population
test   the diagnostic criterion use   and the
length of follow up 3 progression to type 2
diabete among high risk group   include
woman with gdm   can be prevent or
delay 4 6 and detect impaired glucose
tolerance or impaired fasting plasma
glucose   fpg   in often asymptomatic
individual permit intervention such as
dietary counselling   weight management  
and exercise   woman who have have gdm
should have regular lifelong follow up for
diabete   the 2008 national institute for
health and clinical excellence   nice  
diabete in pregnancy guideline   england  
recommend that fpg should be do at a
6 week postnatal check   and if not
diagnostic of diabetes   repeat annually 2
follow up of gdm cross the
primary secondary care divide and involve
two separate specialty within secondary
care   diabete and obstetric   evidence from
the management of other condition
 
require
multidisciplinary
input
emphasise the importance of cooperation
between the various agency to optimise
outcome   there be little publish research
on the current practice of gdm follow up in
primary and secondary care   a recent paper
suggest that canadian physician be not
follow
national
guidance
that
recommend an oral glucose tolerance test
  ogtt   after pregnancy 7
this study aim to examine the report
practice of primary care   gps   and
secondary care   obstetrician and
diabetologist   doctor in england at the
time of publication of the nice diabetes in

conclusion
follow up of gdm in england diverge from
national guidance   despite consensus that
short term follow up occur   primary and

summary
this national survey of post pregnancy
follow up of woman with gdm in england
show that at the time of its publication  
current nice guidance be not consistently
be follow in secondary care or primary
care   and over the follow 10 month it
be show there be no change in gps  
report to suggest they be bring their
practice into line with the nice
recommendation   while there be
consensus that woman have short term
follow up after delivery to exclude ongoing
diabetes   there be considerable
difference between primary and secondary
care about the type of test use and the
venue for follow up   in contrast with the
nice recommendation   80   of specialist
and 30   of gps be use ogtts rather
than fpgs for short term follow up   and
 
british journal of general practice   october 2011 e616
 
 
  10   of specialist and gps report use
ogtts for long term follow up  
strength and limitation
a major strength of this study be that it be
national   whereas previous research in this
area have study local population 9 both
primary and secondary care sector be
survey and a variety of strategy be
use to achieve high response rate   93   of
specialist and 60   of gps   10 a possible
limitation be that primary care responder
be more likely to be interested in diabetic
pregnancy than non responder   make
the primary care result likely to represent a
  good case   scenario   the survey collect
information on self report and not actual
practice   to investigate health professional  
view on their current practice in the context
of the nice diabetes in pregnancy guideline
  england   publish in 2008   the survey be
send out at the time of the publication of the
nice guidance   and all the secondary care
response come in promptly   it would be
interesting to repeat this survey in a couple
of year to see whether the guidance have
alter the report practice of secondary
care   however   the primary care
questionnaire be send out over many
month and no evidence be detect of
increase compliance with the guidance
over the first 10 month follow the
publication of the guidance

comparison with exist literature
the nice diabetes in pregnancy guideline
be publish just prior to this survey and it
be possible that its recommendation have
not yet lead to change in practice   although
no change be find in gps   report
practice over the 10 month of the study
period   other possible reason for
divergence from the nice guideline may be
lack of awareness and ineffective guideline
implementation   it be know that publish
guideline do not necessarily change
practice   in canada   a guideline
recommend ogtt for follow up of gdm
do not increase the number of woman
have an ogtt   although there be a
significant increase in the number of
woman have random serum glucose and
hba1c   glycosylated haemoglobin   test   the
author interpret this as be due to
increase awareness of the need for followup but ignorance of the precise detail of the
guidance 7 there may also be genuine
evidence base scientific disagreement
regard
the
nice
guideline s
recommendation   this be echo by
international difference in guidance about
short term and long term follow up of
 
gdm   the 2007 fifth international workshop
conference on gdm recommend an
ogtt at 6 week postpartum 11 the
american college of obstetrician and
gynecologist   acog   note in 2009 that the
ogtt demonstrate great sensitivity than
the fast glucose test   but that fast
glucose be acceptable 12 and the american
diabetes association   ada   guideline
recommend a fpg in general practice
but recognise the ogtt as a valid
diagnostic method 13 for long term followup   the ada suggest an annual ogtt 13 14
nice s decision to recommend a fpg
rather than an ogtt for short term followup be an economic one 2 and use fpgs
may be inappropriate for ethnically mixed
population 15
this study s report rate of short term
follow up of woman with gdm   98   from
specialist and 80   from gps   may be
high than the actual follow up rate   at a
time when 75   of the fellow of the acog
report routinely perform postpartum
glucose testing in gdm   smirnakis et al
find that only 38   of woman in two large
we academic centre have such follow up 16
internationally   rate of short term followup vary dramatically   38 54   in the us 16 18
and 70 73   in australia 19 20 in the uk   two
hospital   southampton21 and london   j
modder   2008   personal communication  
have quote short term follow up rate of
  79    however   these report be part of
research and service development project
respectively   and be unlikely to reflect wide
practice  
there be very limited publish datum on
the long term follow up of woman who have
gdm   one study show that 40   of woman
who deliver in the we be not test at
all in the 5 year after delivery 22
the present survey have show clear
evidence that opportunity be be
miss with regard to long term follow up
of woman with gdm   with less than half of
the gps proactively recall woman for
screen test   while one third of gps say
that they advise the woman to return for
follow up   this strategy have be show to
be ineffective in other area of screen 23
the study find a lack of agree
protocol between specialist and their
local gps   about one third of gps have
protocol for follow up of woman with gdm  
suggest this be not a high priority area  
to compound the issue   one fifth of gps
report difficulty in determine that a
diagnosis of gdm have be make in
secondary care   there be disagreement
between diabetologist and obstetrician  
even in the same maternity unit   regard
 
 
responsibility for postpartum follow up  
this concur with a previous study show
the need for more uniform and evidencebased criterion for postpartum follow up of
gdm to reduce confusion and wide variation
in clinical practice 24
implication for practice
early detection of ongoing diabete and the
prevention of type 2 diabetes require
systematic and complete follow up of
woman who have have gdm   this study
point to the need for a clear plan of action
to improve short term and long term
follow up of woman with gdm   which be
centrally support and agree across
primary and secondary care   there be an
issue about who be responsible for shortterm postpartum fpg test   it be
important that local specialist and gps
reach agreement on who be responsible   to
do this   there will need to be an agree
share care protocol   which could usefully
be reflect in the patient hold maternity
record   this record could indicate what test
will be do   when   where   and by whom  
 
robust system for transfer of information
be need   particularly with respect to
let the gp know that a woman have be
diagnose with gdm   perhaps the postnatal
note could be redesign to facilitate
record gdm in a checklist link to
short term and long term follow up
action   long term follow up of woman
with previous gdm can only occur in
primary care and gps should be
encourage to recall these woman for
diabete screen annually   include
woman with previous gdm on the diabetes
register of the general practice   read
code gdm   and set up computer alert
to facilitate annual recall for fpg test
might be a straightforward way to do this  
make it a quality and outcome
framework point might also be helpful  
education of both woman and healthcare
professional about the need for follow up
and annual review after a diagnosis of gdm
and how it should be do   be important   as
be joint ownership of follow up strategy by
primary and secondary care sector   and
their patient

introduction
 
for systematic review and meta analysis   prisma statement  
  29   and the cochrane handbook for systematic review of
intervention  
 
the international diabetes federation   idf   estimate that at
least 425 million person in the world have diabete   1   from
1980 to 2014 the global age standardized prevalence of diabetes
in adult more than double in man and increase almost
60   in woman   2    if these trend continue   the world health
organization   who   goal of halt the rise of diabete by
2025 will not be achieve   2    the increase burden of diabetes
challenge individual   family and health system globally  
diabetes can be prevent or delay with intensive lifestyle
change offer to high risk people   as indicate as indicate
by the follow now classical study   the da qe diabetes
prevention study   after 6 year of lifestyle intervention   reduce
the incidence of diabete by 31   46   and 42   in the group of
diet   exercise and diet plus exercise   respectively   3   and benefit
extend over 20 year after the intervention be discontinue
  4    the finnish diabetes prevention study   dps   and the
diabete prevention program   dpp   both show a reduction
of 58   in the incidence of diabetes mellitus in individual with
impair glucose tolerance after an average of 3 year of lifestyle
intervention focus on diet and physical activity   5   6    a
recent systematic review of 43 study evaluate the long term
sustainability of diabetes prevention approach show that the
superiority of lifestyle intervention over medication observe
at the end of the trial persist for many year   7    the review
include 49 029 participant with mean age of 57 3    8 7   year  
indicate that the young age group have be little evaluate  
of great concern   prevalence of type 2 diabetes be increase
among the young   a phenomenon potentially increase the
burden of disease owe to the long duration of diabetes and
the apparently high incidence of chronic complication of those
so affect   8   9    thus   diabete prevention start early than
the setting of most publish trial be of paramount importance  
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   offer a unique opportunity
for diabetes prevention in young adult   first   the diagnosis of
gdm confer an increase risk of diabetes and its complication
which appear to be mediate at least in part by subsequent
weight gain and lack of a healthy lifestyle   10    initial study
test the efficacy of lifestyle intervention suggest benefit   11  
25    but few systematic review have be carry out so far
  26 28    with only one attempt to assess diabete as an
outcome   26   
we aim to systematically review and summarize the benefit of
lifestyle intervention in the prevention of diabetes as well as in
reduction of plasma glucose level and anthropometry measure
in woman with recent gdm   as evaluate in postpartum
randomize control trial  
 
eligibility criterion
the review include all rct involve woman with previous
gdm   as define by any recognize diagnostic criterion   that
compare lifestyle intervention diet and or physical activity
and or breastfeed with usual care without pharmacological
treatment   we include only trial assess the incident of
diabete mellitus   primary outcome   or glycemic level    mean
change from baseline of fasting or 2 h glucose   or hba1c     our
surrogate outcome   we exclude study include woman with
current or previous diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes   use
pharmacological intervention or have recruitment strategy
that be not base on a recent diagnosis of gdm

additionally   heterogeneity across study for these outcome be
large  
we find a consistently great effect in study with
long follow up across the three anthropometric measure  
in these study   the period of intervention be also of great
duration   which suggest the importance of maintain
support for lifestyle change for a long period   particularly
give the woman s frequently overwhelming task of
 
report effect on bmi   waist circumference   2h glucose

the fact that reduction in incidence here report be
somewhat great when the intervention initiate soon after

motivation to initiate lifestyle change when woman be

in conclusion   our comprehensive meta analysis suggest
an effect of lifestyle intervention after a pregnancy complicated
by gestational diabete   the effect be small than those
of the classic study of lifestyle intervention to prevent
diabete in old subject when offer more intensive
intervention   nonetheless   the benefit here report for
young woman with previous gdm suggest that intervention
to prevent diabete be feasible and may have potential
clinical   additional study be need to far tailor the
delivery of lifestyle intervention to this particular period

provide write inform consent  
 
introduction
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be define as a type of
diabetes first diagnose during pregnancy   1    incidence of gdm
vary from 2   to 14   globally and it be increase   2    maternal
glucose have be associate with a risk of adverse pregnancy
outcome in a linear manner   3    borderline gdm have be
link with high rate of cesarean section and induce
delivery   shoulder dystocia and birth injury   4    and pathogenesis in the offspring of overweight and metabolic syndrome   5   
high intake of saturate fat   low intake of polyunsaturated fat  
and excessive gestational weight gain may increase the risk of
gdm   6 10    physical activity be also associate with decrease
risk of gdm   11    lifestyle modification have be show to be a
valuable adjunctive therapy of gdm   12   but to date there be no
adequately power trial on primary prevention of gdm   early
study on prevention of gestational weight gain by dietary and
physical activity counseling have find favorable result   13   and
structure aerobic exercise training have be show to decrease
birthweight of the newborn   14    in our own pilot study   intensive
lifestyle counseling produce favorable change both in diet and
physical activity   15 16    the aim of this cluster randomize trial
be to examine whether individual intensify counseling on
physical activity   diet   and weight gain integrate into routine
maternity care visit could prevent the development of gdm and
newborn   high birthweight adjust for gestational age  
 
intervention
the intervention continue from the first maternity clinic visit
at 8 12 wk gestation until 37 wk gestation   text s1    17    at the
first visit the recommendation for gestational weight gain   18  
be discuss and an appropriate weight gain graph be select
from the follow up notebook to guide the participant in
monitor her weight gain   the primary physical activity
counseling be implement at 8 12 wk gestation and the primary
dietary counseling session at 16 18 wk gestation   the rationale for
implement physical activity and dietary counseling at separate
visit be 2 fold   the nurse   time for counseling be limit to 2 h
in total for the first visit and thus only one primary counseling
focus could be include   secondly   the nurse be more familiar
with dietary issue and   therefore   include physical activity
counsel in the first visit emphasize the difference between
usual care   physical activity counseling be enhance at four   and
diet counseling at three subsequent visit   if ogtt be
pathological at 26 28 wk gestation   woman be additionally
refer to other health care specialist  
aim of the physical activity counseling be to increase leisure
time physical activity of those pregnant woman who be not
fulfil the physical activity recommendation to the recommend level for health   19   and to maintain or adjust leisure time
physical activity of those woman who be already fulfil the
recommendation   the minimum weekly leisure time physical
activity dose   include also light intensity physical activity  
enter progressively in the plan be 800 meet   multiple of
rest metabolic equivalent   minute   this amount be in line with
haskell et al    20    suggest after the initiation of this study the
maximum of 750 meet minute of moderate intensity physical
activity for health   during the primary visit the participant be
offer an opportunity to participate in monthly thematic
meeting on physical activity include group exercise  
evaluation of leisure time physical activity be base on a
validate self report   21   
base on finnish dietary recommendation   the goal of dietary
counseling be to help participant achieve a healthy diet
contain   10   saturate fat   5   10   polyunsaturate fat  
25   30   total fat   and   10   saccharose of total energy intake  
and 25 35 g d fiber   22    a study that be successful in
prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus in finland be use as a
reference   23    in practice   the participant be advise   1   to
consume vegetable   fruit   and berry   preferably at least five
portion   400 g   a day    2   to select mostly high fiber bread    6 g
fiber 100 g   and other whole meal product    3   to select mostly
fat free or low fat version of milk and milk product   e g    yoghurt  
cheese   ice cream   and of meat and meat product    4   to eat fish at
least twice per week   exclude the fish specie not recommend
for pregnant woman     5   to use moderate amount of soft table
spread on bread   oil base salad dress in salad   and oil in
cook and bake    6   to consume seldom and only in smallportion food high in fat   and   7   to consume seldom and only in
small portion snack contain high level of sugar and or fat
  e g    sweet   high sugar drink   cookie   ice cream   sweet and
savoury pastry   potato chip    24   
counseling card help the nurse to standardize their
counsel   the participant use follow up notebook to set their
individual plan for physical activity and dietary change and to a
keep record of their adherence to their plan  
woman in the usual care group receive no counseling beyond
usual care   which include some dietary counseling   partly on
 
method
design and study population
the method of this study have be describe in detail
previously   text s1 and s2    17    the study be a cluster randomize
trial conduct in maternity clinic of primary health care center of
14 municipality in pirkanmaa region in south western finland   all
14 municipality with at least 70 annual delivery be recruit to
the study   the unit of randomization be municipality   in the
randomization process   participate municipality be first
pairwise match with regard to annual number of birth   size
and socio economic level of the population   estimate incidence of
gdm   and urbanity level   municipality be then randomize by
computer   the rationale for use cluster randomization be to
avoid contamination between trial arm   which would have
occur if individual or clinic be randomize   all 53 nurse
work in maternity clinic in these municipality recruit
pregnant woman at 8 12 wk gestation between 1 october 2007
and 31 december 2008   the study be complete at the end of
2009   when all participate woman have give birth  
pregnant woman be eligible to enter the study if they have at
least one of the follow risk factor   body mass index   bmi  
  25 kg m2 base on measure height and self report prepregnancy weight   gdm or any sign of glucose intolerance or
newborn s macrosomia    4 500 g   in any early pregnancy   type
1 or 2 diabete in first   or second degree relative   or age   40 y  
woman be exclude if they have any of the following   at least
one of the three baseline   8 12 wk gestation   oral glucose tolerance

some   none   be use to help the woman to determine the intensity
of their physical activity   in quantify meet minute   3 met
be use for light   5 met for moderate   and 7 met for vigorous
physical activity   in the analysis   moderate and vigorous meet
minute be sum to form meet minute for at least moderate
physical activity   dietary habit be assess by use a validate
181 item food frequency questionnaire   24   at baseline   26 28 wk
gestation   and 36 37 wk gestation   at baseline   the woman be
ask question about their diet during 1 mo prior to the pregnancy  
since their diet may have change due to nausea or vomit at the
begin of the pregnancy   in the follow up   the woman be
ask question about their diet during the previous month  
behavior change   expect to contribute to the possible effect
of the intervention on the outcome   be change in leisure time
physical activity   weekly meet minute   and diet   intake of total fat  
saturate and polyunsaturated fatty acid   saccharose   and fiber   
woman be define to be adherent to the recommendation   if
they fulfil at least four of the five dietary aim and or their
physical activity exceed 800 meet minute wk at 36 37 wk
gestation and their total weight gain do not exceed their bmispecific limit  
the nurse elicit information on select adverse effect   27  
by a structured interview at four of the visit   adverse effect
include nausea   bleed   painful contraction   dizziness   breathlessness   headache   chest pain   tiredness fatigue   calf pain   or
musculoskeletal problem   the response alternative be    no    
   sometimes     and    often

little physical activity counsel   16    all nurse be support
with meeting every third month during the intervention  
 
outcome variable and datum collection
the two primary outcome of the trial be the proportion of
woman with gdm base on 26 28 gestation week ogtt
  maternal outcome   and the newborn   birthweight adjust for
gestational age   neonatal outcome    diagnosis of gdm be base
on the ogtt   at least one of the follow criterion be meet  
fast blood glucose   5 3 mmol l    10 0 mmol l at 1 h   and
  8 6 mmol l at 2 h    1   
in addition to this definition   we also combine the birthweight of
the newborn    4 500 g or   4 000 g   or possible use of insulin or
other diabetic medication during pregnancy to two variation of
gdm diagnosis   since the ogtt might have be pathological
after 26 28 wk gestation   the rationale for use birthweight be
that perform third ogtt measurement at 37 39 wk gestation
be not feasible   the information on the outcome be base both
on hospital record and measurement make by the research group  
level of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance be base on

early study relate to gdm have study   for example

  13 28    landon and colleague    29   trial include woman with
mild gdm   and an australian trial   30   woman with definite
gdm at 24 34 wk gestation   both trial have composite outcome
include perinatal mortality and neonatal complication associate with maternal hyperglycemia   29 30    in our study the main
outcome be gdm and lga newborn   both reflect
maternal hyperglycemia   study in which newborn birthweight
have be a primary outcome have show that treatment of
maternal gestational hyperglycemia can be beneficial on newborn   birthweight   28    in an observational hyperglycemia and
adverse pregnancy outcome   hapo   study   3    maternal blood
glucose level be associate with lga   birthweight above 90th
percentile    in our study   no significant difference between the
group in neonatal ponderal index   total gestational weight gain  
macrosomia   or head circumference be discover   this find
may also be due to the fact that power calculation be base on
the main outcome incidence of gdm   the calculation be not
base on early trial   since there be no similar study available
at the time of the initiation of the study   the proportion of woman
with gdm among the intervention group be expect to be half
low than in the usual care group accord to the power
calculation   but the result do not support reduction   although
the target sample size   n    420   be almost meet   the expect
difference of 40   in the incidence of gdm between the group
be most likely too ambitious and thus the study lack sufficient
power on the gdm outcome   the proportion of exclude woman
with abnormal ogtt already at the 8 12 wk gestation be
unexpectedly high   23 6   in the intervention group   31 3   in the
usual care group    which decrease our sample size   the
recruitment process be 6 mo long than initially plan   since
pregnant woman be reluctant to participate in the lifestyle
modification program because of lack of time or other personal
reason  
gdm treatment trial have use different intervention strategy   use of insulin   self monitoring of glucose   and dietary
intervention   28    lifestyle counseling   in term of physical activity  
diet   and weight gain   have not be incorporate as an intervention
strategy in gdm prevention or treatment in any adequately
power study   physical activity be   however   know to have acute
effect on blood glucose and insulin sensitivity during a gdm
pregnancy   30    which may far lead to favorable effect on
newborn   birthweight   small study with instruct exercise
training and dietary advice have show favorable trend on
reduce excessive weight gain   gdm   and macrosomia   but only
three trial use dietary advice in gdm prevention have be
publish   31    in these trial   low glycemic diet be relate to an
average of 446 g light baby   but the evidence be still
inconclusive due to small sample size and diverse outcome in
the trial   31    in our study   the change observe in dietary
outcome especially by 36 37 wk gestation may at least partly
explain the between group difference observe in birthweight of
the newborn   on the other hand   time from the initiation of the
dietary counseling   16 18 wk gestation onwards   to the measurement of gdm at 26 28 wk gestation may have be too short to
produce change in dietary habit and far to have an effect on

discussion
our study evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle counseling in
primary prevention of gdm among a group of euglycemic
woman with at least one risk factor of gdm   use a clusterrandomize control design   lifestyle counseling be effective in
control the proportion of lga newborn   but the result
concern gdm be inconclusive   the intervention have
beneficial effect on four of the five dietary aim   I e    the intake
of dietary fiber   saccharose   and saturate and polyunsaturated
fatty acid   additionally   a statistically nonsignificant tendency for
low decrease in at least moderate activity meet minute by 26  
28 wk gestation be observe among the intervention group as
compare to the usual care group   woman adherent to the lifestyle

our definition for adherence include achievement of at least four
dietary aim and or the physical activity aim and the weight gain
recommendation   our analysis on adherence suggest that
achievement of the aim of all these three component of the
intervention   rather than only part of they   be associate with a
low risk for lga and may be associate with low risk of
gdm  
another possible reason for negative result concern gdm
prevention may be the risk group status of the woman recruit to
the trial   since we include woman with at least one gdm risk
factor   most woman have quite low risk for develop gdm   if we
have include woman with high risk of gdm   e g    obese woman or
woman with previous insulin treat gdm   the result might have
be different  
our study do not show an increase in the incidence of adverse
event or preterm birth in the intervention group   thus   lifestyle
counseling implement by the nurse may be consider safe  
our counseling procedure have be show to be feasible   15 16   
and it may be more applicable in maternity health care than
intervention deliver by research nurse or other staff   in a
study with individual randomization   not only statistical power  
but also risk for contamination between trial arm would have
be high than in our cluster randomize trial   the generalizability of our finding be high than efficacy trial due to
implementation in real world instead of laboratory setting  
although limit to woman with no abnormal finding in ogtt
during 8 12 wk gestation  
limitation of our study also include the absence of late
pregnancy measurement of maternal glucose intolerance   and
owe to this   we be not able to assess maternal endpoint close
to delivery   and thus high birthweight be use as a marker of
longstanding glucose intolerance during pregnancy   inaccuracy in
birthweight   crown heel length   and head circumference measurement in hospital be likely to be nondifferential   since the possibility
of such error be equal in both group   secondly   the difference
between group might have be even large if this inaccuracy have
not exist   an inevitable limitation be also that the woman and the
nurse in the usual care group could not be blind for the purpose
of the study   which may have result in change in their health
behavior or counseling practice

conclusion
evidence on the primary prevention of gdm and its
consequence among woman at risk but with normal glucose
tolerance have be lack   our study have show that lifestyle
counseling be effective in decrease newborn   birthweight among
woman at risk of gdm and produce behavioral change   we
fail to find an effect on gdm diagnose at 26 28 wk gestation
or later   but the analysis perform among the adherent woman
suggest that favorable change in behavior may decrease the risk of
lga offspring   result from ongoing clinical trial   32 33   may
strengthen the evidence on the effectiveness of lifestyle modification on maternal and fetal hyperglycemia and its consequence  
the finding of our study emphasize counseling on the topic of
physical activity   diet   and weight gain in maternity care especially
for woman at risk for gdm in order to prevent lga newborn
possibly cause problem in delivery   and both the mother s and
the child s late weight development

conclusion
nutritional manipulation in pregnancy base on diet or mixed approach do not appear to reduce the risk of gdm   nutritional supplement show potential as agent for primary prevention of gdm  
 
introduction
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm    define as carbohydrate intolerance first diagnose in
pregnancy   be on the rise worldwide    1   an increase in the number of mother enter pregnancy as obese and with advance maternal age have contribute to this escalation in rate of
gdm   woman with gdm and their child be at risk of adverse outcome in pregnancy and
in the long term    2   about half of mother with gdm be expect to develop type 2 diabetes
within five year after pregnancy    3   in the offspring it be a major contributor to obesity and
type 2 diabete in later life    4   there be a need for safe   simple   effective and acceptable intervention that prevent the development of gdm   such an approach have the potential to improve
maternal and child health   with significant saving to the health care system   5  
intervention that prevent type 2 diabetes might reduce the risk of gdm   nutritional manipulation base on diet and lifestyle be know to significantly lower the rate of type 2 diabetes in non pregnant individual    6   this beneficial effect could be attribute either to the
reduction in the calorie intake   or to the effect of individual component of diet such as yoghurt
and cereal that be rich in probiotics   fibre and vitamin    7 8   currently no such intervention
be offer to mother as part of routine antenatal care to reduce gdm   systematic review todate   be base on limited number of study   and have not provide conclusive evidence on
the benefit of nutritional intervention in prevent gdm    9 11   furthermore   individual
study be underpowered to reliably estimate reduction in the rate of gdm    12  
there be a need to collate the accrue evidence on nutritional manipulation   we systematically review the effectiveness of nutritional manipulation in pregnancy with mainly dietbase intervention   mixed approach with diet and lifestyle   and nutritional supplement in
prevent gdm

discussion
summary of finding
nutritional manipulation base on diet or mixed approach do not appear to prevent gdm  
there be a trend towards beneficial effect in woman on mainly diet base intervention   with a
potential for significant reduction in gdm risk when limit to obese and overweight woman  
nutritional supplement such as probiotic and myo inositol show promising role in the strategy for primary prevention of gdm

relevance to current evidence
until now   there have be no robust evidence to provide guidance on the primary prevention
of gdm due to the small number of study limit to few intervention in publish review  
  38   the number of eligible study have double since our previous review that evaluate the effect of mixed approach   diet and lifestyle modification   on gdm    11   by evaluate all the relevant intervention   our review be the first to systematically assess the effect of nutritional
manipulation in pregnancy on gdm   we comply with current guideline and use a comprehensive search strategy without any language restriction   by include only randomise trial   we avoid some of the pitfall encounter by early review that include quasirandomised study   10   and woman with gdm   9   
 
effect of intervention on gdm
amongst evaluate intervention   diet base intervention appear to show potential for prevent gdm   this could be due to the follow reason   individual dietary and component  
change in gestational weight gain and effect of nutritional supplement

nutrition manipulation for prevention of gdm
 
the intervention promote the uptake of healthy component such as fibre   probiotic and
food rich in vitamin such as myo inositol that may have an additive effect in reduce the concentration of maternal glucose    19 26   the woman in the intervention group have reduce total
energy intake and glycaemic load compare to the control group    30 36   low glycaemic index
diet attenuate the increase in insulin resistance observe in pregnancy   thereby reduce the risk
of gdm    39   the risk of gdm be know to be reduce by a quarter with each 10 g day increment in total fibre intake    40   the large benefit with diet be observe where there be a multidisciplinary input into the intervention   with the use of food diary   31   and feedback method  
diet base intervention have also show the great reduction in gestational weight gain
compare to other method    11   the reduction in gestational weight gain may have influence
the fall in the rate of gdm    11   serum leptin   a know factor associate with gdm   41    be
lower by 20   with reduce gestational weight gain    37   cord leptin concentration be
also increase in newborn bear to mother with diabetes    42  
we do not observe the beneficial effect in the subgroup with mixed approach that combine diet and physical activity   this be consistent with previously publish review that do
not show beneficial effect of physical activity in pregnancy on pregnancy outcome    11 43  
rather than physical activity fail to have an expect impact on gdm   it be likely that
woman in the intervention group have poor compliance with the intervention   objective assessment with method such as accelerometry have show no difference in the physical activity
between the two group    30   the large trial on mixed approach   diet and lifestyle   in pregnancy   the limit study fail to show a benefit with the intervention for gdm and other maternal outcome include gestational weight gain   20   non compliance with the intervention  
with a quarter of woman not attend the require two session with the dietician could have
contribute to the lack of benefit  
simple intervention base on nutritional supplement such as myo inositol and probiotic
appear to have significant potential in prevent gdm   inositol be available in cereal   meat  
fresh fruit and vegetable   corn and legume   the average dietary intake contain 1 g of inositol  
day   myo inositol be know to increase the sensitivity to insulin    44   a possible mechanism for
the observe reduction in gdm  
other supplement such as the probiotic   consist of microorganism of beneficial nature   appear to reduce the risk of gdm when combine with a dietary intervention    26   by alter the gut microbiome   and by modify the concentration of plasma lipopolysaccharide  
probiotic alter the inflammatory pathway and sensitivity to insulin   it be possible that the benefit observe in the luoto trial in reduce gdm   26   be due to a synergistic action between a
diet rich in probiotic in addition to probiotics supplement  
 
safety of the intervention
any intervention evaluate in pregnancy need to pass a rigorous evaluation of its safety to the
mother and baby   our previous detailed evaluation of diet and mixed intervention in pregnancy do not find adverse effect to the mother or baby   except in extreme condition such as starvation    11   although theoretical concern have be raise regard the risk of preterm
delivery with inositol   this be not observe in both randomised and observational study on
inositol in pregnancy   inositol use in early pregnancy may in an additional beneficial role   by
prevent the risk of neural tube defect in folate resistant mother    45  
 
limitation
our finding be limit by difference in the inclusion criterion of the study   variation in the
component of the intervention such as duration   intensity and frequency   non standardise

care in the control group and non uniform definition of gdm   furthermore   woman in the
intervention group have more than one intervention   such as diet and probiotic   make it difficult to delineate the beneficial effect of an individual intervention   it be possible that a different
criterion for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes may have yield change estimate of effect  
  46   woman in the control group may have access these intervention result in hawthorne effect for the follow reason   intervention be easily accessible   include over the
counter nutritional supplement   and absence of blinding of the woman or health care provider  
in any of the include study   none of the study evaluate gdm as a primary outcome  
hence it be possible that the different arm could have be treat differently   such as additional screening for gdm   and close follow up in the intervention group   thereby influence
the outcome   study be limit in their reporting on proportion of woman who comply
with the intervention   which could have a major influence on the effect size observe  
 
clinical applicability
since woman with gdm be mostly see in the secondary care   with frequent follow up include ultrasound assessment of fetal growth   any effective intervention that prevent gdm be
likely to be cost effective in the long run   dietary intervention be complex   and require a
change in the behaviour of mother   to have a positive impact on the outcome   furthermore  
they require reinforcement and feedback with food diary   and regular visit with healthcare
professional such as dietician   midwife and clinician   the diet base intervention may have
a role in primary prevention of gdm   especially in obese and overweight pregnant woman  
with a project increase in the national health service   nhs   spend from   8 8 billion to
  13 billion per year in the next 25 year on type 2 diabetes and its complication    47   primary
prevention of gdm have significant societal and economic benefit   intervention base on diet
and nutritional supplement show potential to prevent gdm   with the possibility of promote
the health of subsequent generation   by reduce the risk of obesity and adult onset diabetes
in child bear to mother with gdm  
 
research recommendation
the role of diet base intervention in obese and overweight pregnant woman   the population
most likely to develop gdm   need further evaluation   the beneficial effect of simple intervention such as probiotic and myo inositol on gdm appear promise   there be a need to
evaluate the effect of supplement by large multicentre randomise trial   involve wide
group of individual such as non caucasian and obese woman   the optimal dose   frequency
and type of inositol isomer need to be identify   similarly the effect of different genera or
strain of probiotic and their varied dose on gdm need to be identify   give the considerable resource require to deliver the complex intervention base on diet   it be possible that
nutritional supplement will also be cost effective   furthermore   they be an attractive option as
they be easily available as over the counter supplement  
 
conclusion
mix approach intervention compose of diet and lifestyle modification do not appear to
prevent gdm   diet base intervention may be beneficial in obese and overweight pregnant
woman   nutritional supplement such as probiotic and myo inositol show benefit and need
further evaluation in large randomised trial  
 
 
 
abstract
the diabetes in pregnancy study group india   dipsi   be report practice guideline for gdm in the indian
environment   due to high prevalence   screening be essential for all indian pregnant woman   dipsi recommend
that as a pregnant woman walk into the antenatal clinic in the fast state   she have to be give a 75 g oral
glucose load and at 2 hrs a venous blood sample be collect for estimate plasma glucose   this one step
procedure of challenge woman with 75 gm glucose and diagnose gdm be simple   economical and feasible  
screening be recommend between 24 and 28 week of gestation and the diagnostic criterion of ada be
applicable   a team approach be ideal for manage woman with gdm   the team would usually comprise an
obstetrician   diabete physician   a diabetes educator   dietitian   midwife and pediatrician   intensive monitoring  
diet and insulin be the corner stone of gdm management   oral agent or analogue though use be still
controversial   until there be evidence to absolutely prove that ignore maternal hyperglycemia when the
fetal growth pattern appear normal on the ultrasonogram   it be prudent to achieve and maintain
normoglycemia in every pregnancy complicate by gestational diabete   the maternal health and fetal outcome
depend upon the care by the committed team of diabetologist   obstetrician and neonatologist   a short
term intensive care give a long term pay off in the primary prevention of obesity   igt and diabete in the
offspring   as the preventive medicine start before birth

tune of glycemic level during pregnancy be possible
due to the compensatory hyperinsulinaemia   as the
normal pregnancy be characterize by insulin resistance  
a pregnant woman who be not able to increase she
insulin secretion to overcome the insulin resistance that
occur even during normal pregnancy develop
gestational diabetes  
the metabolic goal of pregnancy be 1   in early pregnancy
to develop anabolic store to meet metabolic demand in
late pregnancy and 2   in late pregnancy to provide fuel
for fetal growth and energy need  
   dr patrick catalano
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be define as
  carbohydrate intolerance with recognition or onset during
pregnancy    irrespective of the treatment with diet or
insulin   the importance of gdm be that two generation
be at risk of develop diabete in the future   woman
with a history of gdm be at increase risk of future
diabetes   predominately type 2 diabetes   as be their
children1
gdm occur when the woman s beta cell function be not
able to overcome the antagonism create by the anti insulin
hormone of pregnancy and the increase fuel consumption
require to provide for the grow fetomaternal unit

screen
the controversy concern optimal strategy still
continue for the detection and diagnosis of gdm  
american diabetes association   ada   recommend two
step procedure for screening and diagnosis of diabetes
and that too in selective   high risk   population  
compare with selective screening   universal screening
for gdm detect more case and improve maternal and
neonatal prognosis 3 in the indian context   screening be
essential in all pregnant woman as the indian woman
have 11 fold increase risk of develop glucose
intolerance during pregnancy compare to caucasian
woman 4 the recent datum on the prevalence of gdm in
our country be 16 55   by who criterion of 2 hr pg   
140 mg dl   5 as such universal screening during
pregnancy have become important in our country   for
this we need a simple procedure which be economical
and feasible  
dipsi recommend method
as a pregnant woman walk into the antenatal clinic
in the fast state   she have to be give a 75 g oral glucose
load and at 2 hrs a venous blood sample be collect for
estimate plasma glucose   this one step procedure of
challenge woman with 75 gm glucose and diagnose
gdm be simple   economical and feasible 6
 
diagnostic criterion
american diabetes association   carpenter and
couston   recommend 3 hour 100 gm ogtt and
gestational diabetes mellitus be diagnose if any 2
value meet or exceed fpg    95 mg dl   1 hr pg    180
mg dl   2 hr pg    155 mg dl and 3 hr pg    140 mg dl  
this criterion be originally validate against the future
risk of these woman develop diabete and not on the
fetal outcome   carpenter himself now recommend a 2
hour ogtt with 75 gm glucose   the reason for this be
that   when a glucose tolerance test be administer to
non pregnant individual   it be standard to use the 75 g  
2 hour ogtt   use a different glucose challenge in
pregnant versus non pregnant patient lead to
confusion in the laboratory and may result in error in
apply the proper diagnostic criterion   far   the 75 g   2 hour ogtt be in use during pregnancy in many
country around the world   typically use the same
threshold as in non pregnant individual    7 to
standardize the diagnosis of gdm   the world health
organisation   who   propose use a 2 hour 75 gm
ogtt with a threshold plasma glucose concentration
of great than 140 mg dl at 2 hour   similar to that of
igt   outside pregnancy 8 still all these recommendation
  ada and who   have not project the influence of the
glycemic level on fetal outcome  
clarity in label the different magnitude of
abnormal glucose intolerance on pregnancy
increase maternal carbohydrate intolerance in
   japi    vol   54    august 2006
 
pregnant woman without gdm be associate with a
grade increase in adverse maternal and fetal outcomes9
imply that fetal morbidity start at a low maternal
glycemic level     140 mg dl    a number of prospective
and retrospective study have substantiate the
observation that the frequency of adverse fetal outcome
increase with 2hr pg    120 mg dl and take care of
these woman have result in a well fetal outcome 10 14
thus   the datum be robust and indicate that 2 hr    120 mg  
dl need cognizance  
the term   impair gestational glucose tolerance
  iggt    be use by few author to indicate pregnant
woman whose 2 hr pg be    120 mg dl   it may be
appropriate to use the term   decrease gestational
glucose tolerance   dggt    instead of impaired
gestational glucose tolerance   the use of the term
  decrease   be appropriate as it imply only   low  
whereas the term   impair   mean both high and low  
far   quiet frequently we come across   label any
abnormal value in the ogtt not meet the diagnostic
criterion of gdm as igt 15 the use of this term   igt   during
pregnancy may be confuse   as this terminology be also
be use in non pregnant adult with 2 hr pg    140
mg dl   this level be also apply to diagnose gdm by
who criteria   hence it may be prudent to label 2 hr
plasma glucose value    140 mg dl as gdm and a 2 hr
plasma glucose value    120 mg dl as   decrease
gestational glucose tolerance    dggt    the term igt
should not be use to denote any abnormal value during
pregnancy   the figure suggest below be easy to
remember  
with 75 gm ogtt   who criteria

gestational week at which screening be
recommend
practically all the pregnant woman should undergo
screen for glucose intolerance   the usual
recommendation for screening be between 24 and 28
week of gestation   the recent concept be to screen for
glucose intolerance in the first trimester itself as the fetal
beta cell recognize and respond to maternal glycemic
level as early as 16th week of gestation 16 if find negative
at this time   the screening test be to be perform again
around 24th    28th week and finally around 32nd    34th
week  
 
management of gdm
a team approach be ideal for manage woman with
gdm   the team would usually comprise an obstetrician  
diabetes physician   a diabetes educator   dietitian  
midwife and pediatrician   in practice   however   the team
approach be not always possible due to limited resource  
 
www japi org
 
623
 
 
in such circumstance   management by an obstetrician
and physician   with the assistance of an appropriately
skilled dietitian   diabete educator   be acceptable  
a   patient education
the importance of educate woman with gdm   and
their partner   about the condition and its management
can not be overemphasize  
the compliance with the treatment plan depend on
the patient s understanding of  
  
the implication of gdm for her baby and herself
  
the dietary and exercise recommendation
  
self monitoring of blood glucose
  
self administration of insulin and adjustment of
insulin dose
  
identification and treatment of hypoglycemia
  patient and family member  
incorporate safe physical activity
  
development of technique to reduce stress and cope
with the denial  
care should be take to minimise the anxiety of the
woman  
b   medical nutrition therapy   mnt  
a   general principle    all woman with gdm should
receive nutritional counseling   the meal pattern should
provide adequate calorie and nutrient to meet the
need of pregnancy   the expect weight gain during
pregnancy be 300 to 400 gm week and total weight gain
be 10 to 12 kg by term   hence the meal plan aim to
provide sufficient calorie to sustain adequate nutrition
for the mother and fetus and to avoid excess weight gain
and post prandial hyperglycemia   calorie requirement
depend on age   activity   pre pregnancy weight and stage
of pregnancy   approximately 30 to 40 kcal kg ideal body
weight or an increment of 300 kcal day above the basal
requirement be need   pregnancy be not the ideal time
for obesity correction   underweight subject or those
not gain weight as expect   particularly in the third
trimester   require admission to ensure adequate nutrition
to prevent low birth weight infant  
b   calorie count    as a part of the medical nutrition
therapy   pregnant diabetic woman be advise to wisely
distribute their calorie consumption especially the
breakfast   this imply split the usual breakfast into
two equal half and consume the portion with a
two hour gap in between   by this the undue peak in
plasma glucose level after ingestion of the total quantity
of breakfast at one time be avoid   for example if 4 idlis
   chappathi    slice of bread   apply to all type of
breakfast menu   be take for breakfast at 8 am and two
hour plasma glucose at 10 am be 140 mg   the same
quantity divide into two equal portion I e    one portion
at 8 am and remain after 10 be   the two hour post
prandial plasma glucose at 10 00 am fall by 20    30 mg  
  
 
624
 
this advice have scientific basis as the peaking of
plasma glucose be high with breakfast   due to dawn
phenomenon   than with lunch and dinner   far in a
normal person   insulin secretion be also high with
breakfast than with lunch or dinner 17 gdm mother have
deficiency in first phase insulin secretion and to match
this insulin deficiency the challenge of quantity of food
at one time should also be less  
insulin therapy
insulin be essential if medical nutrition therapy fail
to achieve euglycemia   various criterion have be
propose for the initiation of insulin therapy   fourth
international workshop on gdm recommend
lower capillary blood glucose concentration to 140
mg dl at 1 hour and 120 mg dl at 2 hour 18 whereas
ada recommend the option of measure 1 hour post
meal value with cut off of 120 mg dl   19 these
recommendation be base on one single determination  
which reflect a   snap shot   of glucose evaluation rather
than a   video   of continuous glucose profile 20 the
continuous glucose monitoring system have establish
that in normal pregnancy   peak plasma glucose occur
at 60 minute and the value be 108 7    16 9 mg dl 1 in
a woman with gdm   the peak occur between 70    110
minute   at approximately 90 minute   and with a good
glycemic control the value be 103    26 mg dl   20
however   be interstitial fluid glucose it have its own
limitation  
if the fpg concentration on the ogtt be   120 mg dl  
then the patient be start on insulin immediately along
with meal plan   other gdm woman be see within 3
day and be also teach self monitoring of blood glucose
  smbg    smbg be to be perform in fasting and 1 ½
hour after each meal   gdm woman usually have high
post breakfast plasma glucose level compare to post
lunch and post dinner   a few gdm woman do have
post dinner plasma glucose also high   insulin be start
within 1 to 2 week   if the majority   I e    at least four of
seven per week   of fast value exceed 90 mg dl  
similarly   if the majority of post prandial value after a
particular meal exceed 120 mg dl   insulin be start 21
pen injector be very useful and the patient s acceptance
be excellent  
the initial dose of nph insulin could be as low as 4
unit and the dose of insulin can be adjust on follow
up   a few gdm patient may require combination of
short act insulin and intermediate act insulin in
the morning and evening  
  
if a patient have elevate prelunch blood sugar  
regular insulin be usually necessary in the morning
to handle the post breakfast hyperglycemia   as there
be a lag period before the intermediate act insulin
begin to work   the above regimen of regular and
intermediate act insulin in the morning control
hyperglycemia in most case  
 
www japi org
 
   japi    vol   54    august 2006
 
 
  
 
  
 
if the post dinner blood sugar be high   a small dose
of regular insulin be necessary before dinner in
addition to the regular and intermediate acting
insulin give in the morning  
combination of regular and intermediate acting
insulin before dinner may be necessary if fast
blood sugar be high   this combination of short and
intermediate act insulin in the morning and as
well as in the evening be know as mixed and split
dose of insulin regimen   in this regimen two third
of the total daily dose of insulin be give in the
morning and one third in the evening   for each
combination one third dose should be regular
insulin and two third intermediate act insulin  
with this regiman if the patient continue to have
fast hyperglycemia   the intermediate acting
insulin have to be give at bedtime instead of before
dinner   insulin dose be individualize  
 
target blood glucose level
maintenance of mean plasma glucose   mpg   level   
105 mg   be ideal for good fetal outcome 22 this be possible
if fpg and post prandial peak be around 90 mg dl
and 120 mg dl respectively   mpg should not be    86
mg dl as this may cause small for gestational age
infant   22
specie of insulin
it be ideal to use human insulin be least
immunogenic   though insulin do not cross the
placenta   the insulin antibodie due to animal source
insulin can cross the placenta   and stress the fetal beta
cell   increase insulin production and induce
macrosomia   rapid act insulin analogue  
  novorapid humalog   have be find to be safe and
effective in achieve the target post prandial glucose
value during pregnancy 23 lyspro the first analogue to
get category b approval by us fda and aspart have also
be use in pregnancy  
oral antidiabetic drug
recently report have show good fetal outcome in
gdm woman who be on glyburide   micronise form
of glibenclamide    a randomize unblinded clinical trial
compare the use of insulin and glyburide in woman
with gdm who be not able to meet glycemic goal on
meal plan   treatment with either agent result in similar
perinatal outcome   all these patient be beyond the
first trimester of pregnancy at the initiation of therapy 24
more study be require before routinely
recommend glibenclamide during pregnancy
especially during the first trimester itself   metformin have
be find to be useful in woman with polycystic
ovarian disease   pcod   who fail to conceive  
continue this drug after conception be still a
controversy   but there be a few study favour
continuation of metformin throughout pregnancy 25
currently   oral agent be not routinely recommend
   japi    vol   54    august 2006
 
during pregnancy though emerge datum on
glibenclamide and metformin be interesting  
 
monitor glycemic control
the success of the treatment for a woman with gdm
depend on the glycemic control maintain with meal
plan or pharmacological intervention   to know the
effectiveness of treatment   monitoring of glycemic control
be essential  
  
once diagnosis be make   medical nutritional therapy
  mnt   be advise initially for two week   if mnt
fail to achieve control I e    fpg    90 mg dl and or
1 ½ hr ppg    120 mg dl   insulin may be initiate  
  
once target blood glucose be achieve   woman with
gdm till the 28th week of gestation require lab
monitoring of both fasting and 1 ½ hr post breakfast
once a month and at other time of the day as the
clinician decide  
  
after the 28th week of gestation   the laboratory
monitoring should be more frequent atleast once in
2 week   if need be more frequently  
  
after 32 week of gestation   lab monitoring should
be do once a week till delivery  
  
in high risk pregnancy   frequency of monitor
may be intensify with smbg  
  
continuous glucose monitoring device be available
but these equipment need special training and be
expensive   these device may be useful in high risk
pregnancy to know the glycemic fluctuation and
to plan proper insulin dosage  
throughout the stage and phase of a diabetic woman   her
health status be directly dependent on her nutritional status
and her blood glucose control   as a woman age   to prevent
the increase risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease
of the diabetic woman   exercise and hormonal replacement
therapy can minimize the ravage of diabete per se on the
age process   normoglycemia throughout the lifecycle of
a diabetic woman result in a lifecycle of health  
   dr lois jovanovic
hba1c level
if the glucose intolerance be detect in the early
pregnancy   hba1c level will be helpful to differentiate
between a pre gestational diabetic and gdm   if the
hba1c level be more than 6    she be likely to be a pre
gdm   hba1c be useful in monitor the glucose control
during pregnancy   but not for the day to day
management   a1c level may serve as a prognostic value  
estimation of fructosamine during pregnancy be less
frequently use  
measure other parameter
the blood pressure have to be monitor during every
visit   examination of the fundus and estimation of
microalbuminuria   every trimester be recommend  
 
www japi org
 
625
 
 
e   ultrasound fetal measurement    the management of
gestational diabete   base on the foetal growth by
ultrasonogram demand that the fetus at risk must first
manifest overgrowth before treatment decision be
make   further   the cost of perform a number of
ultrasonograms to monitor the foetal growth and
recommend therapy have to be keep in mind   until
there be evidence to absolutely prove that ignore
maternal hyperglycemia when the fetal growth pattern
appear normal on the ultrasonogram   it be prudent to
achieve and maintain normoglycemia in every
pregnancy complicate by gestational diabete  
until there be evidence to absolutely prove that ignore
maternal hyperglycemia when the fetal growth pattern

   dr lois jovanovic
 
obstetric consideration
fetal evaluation
an ultrasound scan have to be perform around 18   
20 week of gestation focus on structure namely the
spine   skull   kidney and heart   fetal echocardiography
have to be do around 20    24 week which allow to
view all the four chamber of the heart   from 26th week
onwards   fetal growth and liquor volume have to be
monitor every 2 3 week   fetal abdominal
circumference provide baseline for further serial
measurement which give growth acceleration or
restriction   fetal movement be monitor from 20 week
onwards   screen for chromosomal anomaly be
necessary in pre gdm   screening should be do for
down s syndrome   alpha feto protein for neural defect
and human chorionic gonadotrophin to identify any
chromosomal abnormality   16    20 week of gestation   
the obese fetus of gdm mother be also hyperinsulinemic  
thus interaction between leptin and insulin may be a link
between maternal diabete and increase adiposity in the
fetus  
   dr sylvie hauguel de mouzon
gdm or severe obesity be superimpose to pregnancy   the
result metabolic syndrome become detrimental for the
fetus   evolve towards fetal overgrowth with increase
adiposity at birth   this may be one major component for in
utero programming of obesity later in life  
   dr sylvie hauguel de mouzon
timing of delivery
sudden intrauterine fetal demise in the third trimester
of diabetic pregnancy be not uncommon   to avoid this
risk   preterm delivery be recommend   but with this  
respiratory distress syndrome   rd   be likely to occur  
administer steroid for lung maturity or ß adreno
626
 
receptor agonist to inhibit premature uterine contraction
be likely to induce adverse metabolic effect due to their
glycolytic   glycogenolytic and lipolytic effect   in this
situation   extra insulin may be require to maintain
euglycemia   foetal demise can also occur due to
preeclampsia   which can produce fetal hypoxia via
decrease uteroplacental perfusion   some centre allow
woman with uncomplicated diabete to go into
spontaneous labor irrespective of the gestational age  
but most still advocate delivery at 38 week as perinatal
mortality and morbidity appear to increase after this
time   induction at 38 week gestation may be slow or
unsuccessful due to unfavourable condition of the
cervix but this have to be balance against the poorly
define and predictable risk of late intra uterine death  
if pregnancy be allow to continue more than 38 week  
fetal health may deteriorate suddenly   hence obstetric
management should not be rigid and each case need
individual care and attention   have a neonatologist
support at the time of delivery be advisable  
intra partum management
  
if labor be to be induce in gdm   the usual evening
insulin dose should be take the night before   but
no subcutaneous insulin be give the following
morning when induction begin  
  
once labor begin   insulin be not necessary  
  
in a gestational diabetic the requirement of insulin
be likely to fall precipitously and no insulin may be
require immediately after expulsion of placenta  
 
delivery
a paediatrician experience in resuscitation of   the
newborn should be present whether delivery be vaginal
or by caesarean section   as soon as the infant be bear  
the follow action be mandatory  
  
early clamp of the cord   I e   within 20 second of
delivery   to avoid erythrocytosis  
  
evaluate vital sign   apgar score at 1 and 5 minute  
  
clear oropharynx and nose of mucus   later empty
the stomach    be aware that stimulation of the
pharynx with the catheter may lead to reflex
bradycardia and apnoea  
  
avoid heat loss   keep neonate warm   transfer to
incubator pre warm to 34oc  
  
perform a preliminary physical examination to
detect major congenital malformation  
  
monitor heart and respiratory rate   colour   and
motor behaviour for at least the first 24 hour after
birth  
  
start early feed   preferably breast milk   at 4 6
hour after delivery   aim at full caloric intake   125
kcal kg 24 hour   at 5 day   divide into six to eight
feed a day  
  
promote early infant parent relationship   bonding

the neonate be usually well care for   in a specialized
neonatal unit   interference with the infant should be
minimal   the neonate should be observe closely after
delivery for respiratory distress   capillary blood glucose
should be monitor at 1 hour of age and before the first
four breast feeding   and for up to 24 hour in high   risk
neonate    amperometric blood glucose meter be
acceptable for use in neonate   provide that suitable

1   introduction
improve maternal health and reduce childhood mortality be two of the united nation s
eight millennium development goal   mdgs    they represent a unique and daunting challenge
for healthcare provider worldwide   1 2    the mdgs be support by organization such as the
international federation of gynecology and obstetric   figo    which focus its effort on the
reduction of non communicable maternal disease   ncds   and exposure in pregnancy to improve the
future health of woman and their offspring   specifically   figo be target hyperglycemia   obesity  
hypertension   and poor nutrition in pregnancy to reduce the development of disease later in life  
such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus   t2d    this be important   as the goal of early intervention
be not only to improve future maternal health but also to reduce disease prevalence in subsequent
generation   2   
pregnancy be often describe as a   window   to future health   3    since the physiologic change that
occur during this time act as a natural   stress test   for the body   many woman seek medical care during

their pregnancy   which make this an opportune time for preventive healthcare guidance   in recent
year   there have also be a grow realization that the intrauterine environment   e g    the maternal
nutritional status   influence the health of offspring throughout their lifespan   4 5    the emerge field
of the developmental origin of health and disease   dohad   posit that intrauterine and early infant
environment have a permanent conditioning or programming effect on the body s metabolism and
health later in life  
one common physiological change that can occur during pregnancy be the development of
glucose intolerance cause hyperglycemia   this be refer to as gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   
the pathophysiology of gdm be not fully understand but have be link to hormonal imbalance
affect insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β cell dysfunction   6    it be estimate that one in every six
pregnancy worldwide be associate with hyperglycemia   84   of which be classify as gdm   2   
gdm be an important determinant of the development of t2d in both mother and their offspring  
and thus   achieve glycemic control during pregnancy may provide a window of opportunity to
prevent and lower the burden of t2d in many generation  
the goal of this review be to elaborate on how peripartum nutrition affect longstanding maternal
and neonatal outcome   as well as health risk that likely persist into future generation   we aim to
summarize current knowledge and datum on gdm   with a specific emphasis on screen   diagnosis  
and peripartum complication and preclinical model of the disease   understand risk factor and
improve diagnosis will allow early identification and intervention   with the goal of prevent
future complication  
2   gestational diabetes mellitus
gdm   define as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy   7    be a
common antepartum condition impact about 9 25   of pregnancy worldwide   8 9    with rate
fluctuate depend on study population and diagnostic criterion   gdm be characterize by impaired
glucose tolerance as a result of maternal pancreatic β cell dysfunction   result in the insufficiency of
insulin to regulate glucose homeostasis during pregnancy   10   
insulin   an anabolic hormone release by the β cell in the pancreas   modulate glucose homeostasis
by stimulate glucose uptake into peripheral tissue   inhibit glucose production by the liver  
and suppress store lipid release from the adipose tissue   insulin resistance be a state in which
normal concentration of insulin fail to achieve an appropriate biological response downstream of the
insulin receptor   as a result   the β cell have to release more insulin than usual to regulate maternal
blood glucose level   in a healthy pregnancy   a condition of progressive insulin resistance occur in the
mother   trigger by placental hormone to ensure the fetus receive adequate nutrient for healthy
growth and development   in order to maintain glucose homeostasis despite insulin resistance   the
maternal β cell compensate by increase total cell number   insulin synthesis   and insulin secretion   11   
however   when the maternal β cell be unable to adapt to the metabolic change accompany
pregnancy   hyperglycemia of gdm occur  
3   risk factor for gdm
3 1   modifiable risk factor
3 1 1   overweight   obesity   and pre pregnancy body mass index   bmi  
during pregnancy   maternal dyslipidemia be a physiological response that provide fuel and
nutrient for both the placenta and the develop fetus   12    it be not unusual to observe weight
gain in pregnancy   mark by deposition and hypertrophy of adipocyte in the maternal adipose
tissue   13    while pregnant mother be expect to gain about 30   of their gestational weight in body
fat   14    overweight and obesity be the most associated risk factor for gdm   15    pre pregnancy
bmi alone be an important risk factor for gdm   16    the world health organization   who   define
 
 
int   j   mol   sci   2020   21   5003

overweight and obesity as an abnormal or excessive fat accumulation base on bmi    25 kg m2 or
   30 kg m2    respectively   give the current epidemic of obesity and the increase rate of obesity
in child bear woman   it be estimate that there be 38 9 million overweight and 14 6 million
obese pregnant woman worldwide   17    for people who be overweight and obese   increase lipid
production lead to the accumulation of lipid   mainly triglyceride   in the adipose tissue and other
organ   such as the liver   hepatic insulin resistance be increase in obesity and be far exacerbate
by pregnancy   thus increase the risk of develop gdm   18    moreover   be overweight or
obese during pregnancy can increase the risk of adverse consequence such as metabolic disorder  
hypertension   19    premature delivery   20    and stillbirth   21 22    as well as other   23    for these
reason   obstetrician regularly assess the bmi and gestational weight gain of pregnant woman   24  
in order to prevent complication for both mother and child   the current prevention strategy to
manage body weight during pregnancy include nutritional therapy and improve dietary and lifestyle
habit   25 27   
3 1 2   metabolic syndrome and nutritional diet
the term metabolic syndrome be first use by the national cholesterol education program
adult treatment panel iii to describe the clustering occurrence of metabolic disorder such as
obesity   dyslipidemia   hypertension   and abnormal glucose metabolism under one common condition  
metabolic syndrome when accompany by a western style diet high in sweet   fat   and process
food   be know to increase the occurrence of gdm   28 32    in addition   vitamin d deficiency and high
dietary acid load may also contribute to the risk of gdm   33   
notably   the first line of prevention or treatment for metabolic syndrome be nutritional diet therapy  
which have be show to be beneficial in maintain glucose control and physiologic health   34 36   
nutritional therapy   such as high fiber and low glycemic index diet   have be show to improve
insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance   which may reduce the risk for gdm   37 42    recent literature
have also show the benefit of probiotic therapy in improve blood glucose level by target the gut
microbiota   43 45    finally   anti hyperglycemic medication   such as insulin therapy and metformin  
can be introduce when lifestyle modification alone be not sufficient to achieve glycemic control   46   
3 1 3   polycystic ovary syndrome   pcos  
gdm and polycystic ovary syndrome   pcos   be the most common endocrine disorder in
woman of reproductive age   pcos be a heterogeneous endocrine and metabolic disorder characterize
by chronic oligomenorrhea   47    hyperandrogenism   48    and insulin resistance   49    like gdm   pcos
be associate with insulin resistance and obesity   50    while the risk for gdm increase for woman with
pcos in the presence of other comorbiditie   such as obesity and increase maternal age   pcos per se
be not an independent risk factor for gdm   51 52    in a prevalence study in california   datum show that
pregnant woman with pco have more than a twofold risk for gdm compare with woman without
pcos or related symptom   53    indeed   the prevalence of pcos be high in woman with gdm than in
non diabetic woman   51    pco be often associate with metabolic syndrome   and common prevention
strategy include lifestyle modification   54 55   and pharmacological treatment   56   
3 1 4   pre eclampsia
pre eclampsia be a common hypertensive disorder that occur in 2 8   of all pregnancy
worldwide   57 58    like gdm   pre eclampsia be link to glucose intolerance   hyperglycemia   and
obesity   59    hyperglycemia be know to increase the risk of pre eclampsia   60 62    in subsequent
pregnancy   pre eclampsia be an independent risk factor for gdm   61   
3 1 5   additional modifiable risk factor for gdm
a few study have determine that prolong exposure to environmental psychological stress
be relate to maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy   which may increase the risk of gdm   63   
 
 
int   j   mol   sci   2020   21   5003
 
4 of 21
 
similarly   the use of antidepressant and psychotropic medication   smoke   and poor sleep hygiene
have also be show to be risk factor for gdm   64 66   
3 2   non modifiable risk factor
3 2 1   maternal age
maternal age be a common risk factor for gdm   study have show that maternal age above
25 30 year increase the risk of develop gdm   67 70    in a meta analysis study investigate
the relationship between maternal age and the risk of gdm   author identify a linear relationship
between the risk for gdm and increase maternal age   it be also indicate that for every successive
year after the age of 18   the risk for gdm increase by 7 90    12 74    and 6 52   in the general   asian  
and europid population   respectively   71   
3 2 2   gravidity and parity
increase gravidity   define as the number of time that a woman have be pregnant   and parity  
I e    the number of time that she have give birth   may represent an additional risk for gdm   69   
this elevated risk of develop gdm have be link to parity as low as two   67 72    the effect
of gravidity on the risk of gdm have be associate with increase age as well   since an increase
number of pregnancy be observe in woman with advanced maternal age   73   
3 2 3   ethnicity
several study have link gdm development with ethnicity   increase risk of gdm be see in
multiple ethnic and racial group   include hispanic   african american   and asian woman   73 74   
woman of korean   chinese   and filipino descent be more than twice as likely to develop gdm as
caucasian or african american woman   75    although the mechanism remain unclear   possible
explanation can arise from health predisposition   lifestyle   cultural factor   and socioeconomic
stressor   71 73    in regard to t2d study   south asians have be report to have reduce fat
metabolism   muscle fitness   insulin sensitivity   and insulin secretion   all of which support a high
tendency towards glucose intolerance   76 77    take ethnicity as a risk factor for gdm   it be therefore
important for health provider to recognize that certain ethnic group may benefit from special
preventive and culturally sensitive care   further   structural change   such as combat systemic
racism and bias be necessary to break down disparity associate with these preventable ncd  
3 2 4   genetic and family history of hyperglycemia
gdm be a multifactorial disease with both genetic and environmental influence   a family history
of diabetes be an important independent risk factor for the development of gdm   78    there be a
strong association between common t2d risk gene polymorphism and gdm   79    five of the most
identify gene in gdm be    1   transcription factor 7 like 2   tcfl7l2    80 81     2   melatonin receptor
1b   mtnr1b    82 83     3   cdk5 regulatory subunit associate protein 1 like 1   cdkal1    84 85   
  4   potassium voltage gate channel   kqt like subfamily   member 1   kcnq1    86 87    and   5   insulin
receptor substrate 1   irs1    88 89    the most recent and comprehensive search in the genetic and
epigenetic etiology of gdm have be review elsewhere   90 91    these epigenetic modification
may result in maternal and paternal transgenerational inheritance of obesity and glucose intolerance in
the offspring   92 94    moreover   the type of genetic variation and the mechanism of epigenetic may
contribute to genotypic and phenotypic characteristic in different ethnicity   95 96    for example  
study that explore the relationship between ethnicity and gdm reveal that asian woman have
the high gdm incidence   97 98    the variability in the association of genetic polymorphism and
risk of gdm have be attribute to ethnicity or population difference   thus   there be a need to perform
population dependent study on the effect of genetic polymorphism on the risk of gdm   99 100

3 3   socioeconomic and geographic risk factor
3 3 1   climate and geographical location
the who recognize that vary climate condition from extreme winter temperature to
summer temperature have an impact on human health   there be increase evidence show the
influence of temperature on physiologic mechanism such as the regulation of fat and lipid   101 102   
energy expenditure   hormonal homeostasis   103    myocardial infarction   104    and mortality   105   
climate also appear to have an effect on gdm   in region with seasonal weather change there be a
high prevalence of gdm than in more temperate region of the world   106   
3 3 2   education and socio economic status
base on observational study   many woman diagnose with gdm be unaware of the risk factor
and complication of their diagnosis   107 109    a study in finland report that there be an inverse
relationship between socioeconomic status and gdm   110    this be support by finding that patient
who be uninsured and underinsured receive less preventive healthcare   with some receive little or
no healthcare at all   111 112    to improve the efficacy of gdm treatment   promote health education
combine with government support to patient be an important component of prenatal care   113   
several strategy show to be beneficial in promote awareness of gdm and improve pregnancy
outcome include the use of web base education   97   and or of individual or group educational
session with a healthcare provider or a dietician   114 116   
3 4   screening and diagnosis
3 4 1   laboratory evaluation
to fully address the increase prevalence of gdm worldwide   routine screening for gdm during
prenatal care be necessary   however   only few country routinely test pregnant woman universally  
in the united states   the american college of obstetrician and gynecologist   acog   recommend all
pregnant woman be test in the mid trimester   between 24 and 28 week of gestation    117    in some
country   testing be complete base on the risk assessment do by the obstetrician gynecologist  
risk be categorize by doctor as low   average   or very high   low risk individual be those whose
age be below 25 year   with normal pre pregnancy weight   member of an ethnic group with a low
prevalence of diabetes   no know diabete in first degree relative   no history of abnormal glucose
tolerance   and no history of poor obstetric outcome  
although there be no international   standardized consensus on the screening test to be use  
the oral glucose tolerance test   ogtt   be commonly utilize   118 119    there be two current approach
for test gdm   in the one step approach   a single 75 g ogtt be conduct   while in the two step
approach   an initial screening use a 50 g oral glucose challenge test   ogct   be perform   if the result
of this test show a glucose value equal or great than 7 7 mmol l   130 140 mg dl    117    the pregnant
woman analyze should undergo a confirmatory 100 g ogtt several day after the ogct   120 122   
table 1 below show the comparison between the one step approach and the two step approach  
numerous study have evaluate these screening modality   one study compare the prevalence
and pregnancy outcome of thai gdm patient screen use the one step   75 g ogtt and the
two step approach   the result show a very high prevalence of gdm when the one step approach
be utilize   however   there be no clear evidence of well performance of this test   this high
prevalence see use the one step approach be associate with the use of a low threshold for
diagnosis   which thus lead to an increase sensitivity   123    a high sensitivity may result in an
increase number of false positive and overdiagnosis and treatment   with increase risk of unnecessary
intervention   high cost   and decrease maternal satisfaction with testing and prenatal care   125   
the two testing approach present advantage and disadvantage   while the one step approach have a
low economic burden and a low threshold   allow for the early diagnosis of milder disease and

possible early prevention of complication in the mother and baby   124 126    the two step approach be
less convenient economically and require more time for diagnosis   though it still provide diagnostic

3 4 2   criterion for gdm diagnosis
the selection criterion for the diagnosis of gdm be controversial because of issue in determine
the standard reference interval for gdm diagnosis   the standardization of global criterion be a challenge
because gdm be influence by genetic   ethnicity   and socioeconomic and societal factor   the follow
health professional and study group have propose their own diagnostic criterion   american diabete

3 5   complication
gdm be characterize by hyperglycemia diagnose during pregnancy   cause by or compound
with underlying mechanism such as genetic predisposition   insulin resistance   and chronic
inflammation   although the condition be usually transient   it be a risk factor for the development of t2d
 
 
int   j   mol   sci   2020   21   5003

later in life and may also lead to long term adverse effect in both mother and offspring   this session
enumerate the possible metabolic and physical change result from gdm development  
3 5 1   maternal complication
in gdm   hyperglycemia may damage endothelial cell   which can result in vascular
dysfunction   138   associate with hypertension   139    because of this   it be have be suggest
that gdm increase the incidence of hypertension during pregnancy and the postpartum period   140   
both diabete and hypertension be risk factor for the development of pre eclampsia   a disorder which
affect between 3   and 5   of pregnancy worldwide and be characterize by high blood pressure and
proteinuria   141 142   
although hyperglycemia during pregnancy usually resolve after delivery   prolong insulin
resistance and β cell dysfunction can also be observe in gdm patient   persist beyond
pregnancy   143    because of this   woman with previously diagnose gdm have an increase
risk of develop t2d later in life   144 148    with a risk high as 50    149    also   woman who
have develop gdm in previous pregnancy may experience a recurrence of gdm in subsequent
pregnancy   150 151    for this reason   all woman who carry a diagnosis of gdm should have a 2 h
glucose tolerance test at their 6 week post partum visit   117   
3 5 2   fetal complication
the develop fetus have a limited ability to produce glucose   therefore   it derive most of its
glucose from maternal blood   maternal glucose cross the placenta   while maternal insulin do
not   as a result   accord to the modify pedersen s hypothesis   if maternal glucose level be
high and uncontrolle   the excess glucose transport through the placenta induce increase fetal
insulin production regardless of glucose stimulation   152    this be support by the observe increase
in the expression of glucose transport protein   glut   in the placenta in pregnancy affect by
insulin dependent diabete mellitus   153    insulin can also stimulate mtor   a potent regulator of cell
growth   154    an increase of placental mtor activity due to increase maternal insulin result in
increase cell proliferation and nutrient transport to the fetus via system a and system l amino acid
transporter in the placenta   155 156    hart et al   review the role of mtor as a nutrient sensor in
fetal growth   157   
because of the aforementione factor see in gdm   maternal hyperglycemia and
hyperinsulinemia can lead to similar change in the fetus   158 159    which can contribute to neonatal
adiposity   160    excess nutrient storage result in an increase in neonatal size at birth   or macrosomia  
between 15   and 45   of gdm pregnancy result in macrosomic infant   152    with the bulk of
adiposity concentrate around the fetal abdoman and shoulder   increase the risk for shoulder
dystocia and birth trauma   161    the presence of gdm   couple with other risk factor like hypertension
and obesity during pregnancy   may also lead to preterm labor and birth   162    a prevalence that reach
about 10 6   worldwide   163   
3 5 3   neonatal complication
neonatal complication include possible asphyxia   hypoglycemia   kernicteru and jaundice  
bacterial infection   neonatal respiratory distress syndrome   nrd    and birth trauma   include
shoulder dystocia and injury to the brachial plexus   152    neonatal hypoglycemia occur as a result
of the abrupt cessation of the maternal source of glucose at birth   164    this be exacerbate by
fetal hyperinsulinemia due to gdm and require extensive treatment and care if the hypoglycemia
persist   165   
3 5 4   childhood and adulthood complication
the association between gdm and hyperglycemia in the offspring be well establish   in the
united states   the study of the pima indians provide initial evidence that maternal hyperglycemia
 
 
int   j   mol   sci   2020   21   5003
 
8 of 21
 
could lead to adult disease in the offspring   several epidemiological study demonstrate the pima
indian population as have the high prevalence of t2d among child and adult   166    indeed  
the offspring of diabetic mother be more often prone to obesity   hypertension   and dyslipidemia
later in life   167    the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome   hapo   study in 10 country
reveal that maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy be significantly associate with an increase in
hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in the offspring in adulthood   168    marker for insulin resistance  
like homa ir   bmi   waist circumference   and triglyceride level   be also at high level in gdm
offspring than in those bear to normoglycemic mother   169 170    presumably   the development of
insulin resistance increase the risk of the offspring to develop diabete   with approximately 20   of
gdm offspre develop t2d and prediabete by age 22   171 172   
the increase development of obesity observe in the offspring of mother with gdm be also
associate with an increase risk of metabolic disorder include cardiovascular disease and insulin
resistance   173    child bear to gdm mother be observe to have significantly high blood
pressure and adiposity   along with hyperglycemia and bmi   174 175    as a result of increase
cardiovascular risk   gdm offspring be more likely to develop cardiac arrhythmias and be hospitalize
for cardiovascular disease   cvds    176    gdm offspring be also 29   more likely to develop early onset
cvds such as heart failure   hypertensive disease   deep vein thrombosis   and pulmonary embolism   177   
all of these study point to the influence of the environment in utero in the programming of metabolic
disease in the offspring   this be an important factor to consider   because overnutrition   physical
inactivity   and or genetic factor alone be not sufficient to explain the current epidemic increase in t2d
and obesity   monterio et al   review the mechanism of fetal programming in gdm elsewhere   178   
4   preclinical model of gdm
to stop the vicious cycle of diabetes   we need a great understanding of the pathophysiology of
gdm and the mechanism of fetal programming induce by gdm   as previously mention   this
be an essential endeavor   because gdm confer short   and long term health risk for the mother and
the fetus   with potential long term health consequence in childhood and adulthood   179    however  
establish causality be difficult in human and epidemiological study   which be often complicated
by confound multiple factor   therefore   experimental animal model be critical to study the
underlie mechanism and pathophysiology of gdm   method for generate animal model of gdm
be diverse and include the surgical removal of all or part of the pancreas   the use of pharmacological
agent   diet induce strategy   and genetic model   180   
4 1   surgical model
surgical model include partial or total pancreatectomy   directly reduce the availability of
pancreatic β cell and dramatically impair glucose homeostasis   180    one study perform
pancreatectomy in a rat model to reduce the pancreatic mass by 95    result in uterine dysfunction
in pregnant rat with mild gdm   181    while pancreatectomy be successful in induce gdm  
it be perform prior to pregnancy   which do not accurately reflect the development of human
gdm   pancreatectomy have also be show to induce hyperglycemia and diabete in healthy baboon  
however   such model be rarely use in the context of pregnancy   182    while the surgical removal
of the pancrea may induce maternal diabetes during pregnancy   it be an invasive and nonspecific
procedure   as it remove both the endocrine and the exocrine tissue of the pancreas   180    this may
result in potential effect not relate to gdm  
4 2   pharmacological model
pharmacological agent   include streptozotocin   stz   and alloxan   have be use to selectively
destroy the pancreatic β cell and impair β cell function   183 184    chemical agent offer a relatively
easy way to generate maternal hyperglycemia and diabetes   however   there be inconsistency in
the effect of chemical agent   depend on drug delivery method   dose   specie   age   diet   and

time of gestation at which the drug be administer   while rodent be more commonly use as
model for chemical induce diabetes study   stz have be use in nonhuman primate to study
the effect of maternal diabete on the offspring   185    in female rhesus monkey   stz treatment
induce hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance   185 186    the treat animal be also find to have
large placenta and neonate   as well as a high incidence of stillbirth   186    while both surgical and
chemical animal model have be use to reproduce gdm   neither be able to accurately simulate the
condition of human gdm   pancreatectomy and the use of stz and alloxan permanently remove the
endocrine function of the pancreas   reduce insulin and result in a permanent state of diabetes  
this be unlike gdm in human   usually a transitory disease that develop as a consequence of maternal
insulin resistance   compound by increase amount of human placental lactogen throughout
pregnancy and the inability of the maternal pancreatic β cell to adapt   180    it be also important to
acknowledge that there can be fundamental similarity and important difference between rodent
and human regard islet biology   for example   there be still a debate on β cell compensation
during pregnancy in rodent model vs   human   187    because limit human autopsy study do not
consistently support the mechanism observe in rodent  
4 3   diet induce model
diet induce model of gdm include high fat feeding in animal model to induce insulin
resistance and diabete   a study use a high fat diet   hfd   demonstrate that in the non pregnant
state   female rat   while obese   display normal glucose clearance   after successful mating with
control male   pregnant female on hfd display hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance   188   
in another study   pregnant female rat be administer continuous glucose infusion during the
last week of gestation   induce hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia   189    the offspring bear to
these female have phenotype resemble those of child bear to mother with gdm   while a gdm
animal model involve obesity may represent actual risk factor for human gdm   these model do
not consider the genetic and social factor contribute to the development of the disease  
4 4   genetic model
genetic model have be use to induce gdm in animal   the db db mouse model of leptin
deficiency be currently the most widely use model of t2d   normally   db    female animal present
a normal glucose homeostasis phenotype   however   during pregnancy   they develop spontaneous
gdm   and pup display characteristic similar to those of infant of gdm mother   190    for example  
the offspring of db    dam with gdm exhibit obesity and insulin resistance in the liver   another
model that have be describe be the prolactin receptor deficient   prlr       mouse   while prlr     female
be unable to carry a pregnancy to full term   prl     dam exhibit hyperglycemia and failure to
increase β cell mass and proliferation during pregnancy   a necessary event to maintain euglycemia   191   
in the non pregnant state   these female mouse present with euglycemia and decrease β cell mass  
other genetic model that have investigate transcription factor and different key signaling pathway
to induce gdm be discuss elsewhere   180 192 193    genetic model provide an opportunity to
study the underlie mechanism involve in the pathogenesis of gdm   unfortunately   conclusion
may be limit   as they be often base on single gene mutation   which do not accurately mimic the
polygenetic and environmental factor contribute to human gdm  
4 5   fetal programming model
several novel model of gdm have be generate by use the first generation offspring   f1  
of dams   f0   from various intrauterine programming procedure   in a study use a rat model   stz  
a toxin that promote pancreatic β cell demise   be administer to f0 generation female pup to
induce diabete   194    after successful mating with nondiabetic male   the female f1 pup be use to
study gdm during pregnancy   they find that non pregnant f1 pup be euglycemic but develop
hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia during pregnancy   this suggest that exposure to a diabetic

intrauterine environment may set up female offspring to develop gdm during pregnancy   in another
study   a uteroplacental insufficiency rat model be use to generate intrauterine growth restrict
  iugr   offspring   195    after successful breeding of the iugr female offspring to normal male  
pregnant female demonstrate glucose impairment and insulin resistance   the offspring of these
female rat exhibit increase body weight   insulin resistance   and impaired glucose clearance  
eventually develop diabete   in another mouse model   researcher use the f1 offspring bear to
dams feed a low protein   lp   diet during gestation and lactation   the f1 female develop glucose
intolerance and reduce β cell proliferation during pregnancy   196    these model demonstrate that
exposure to gdm or glucose intolerance during gestation increase the susceptibility of the offspring
  f1   to develop gdm  
animal model have also be use to study the consequence of gdm on the health of the
offspre   offspring bear to mother with gdm be at increase risk for obesity   glucose intolerance  
and diabete   179    in the previously mention study by gauguier et al    in which gdm be induce
in female rat by continuous glucose infusion administer during the last week of pregnancy   189 197   
female offspring demonstrate glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion   when these female
offspring be mate with control male   the newborn offspring present with hyperglycemia  
hyperinsulinemia   and increase body weight   which persist into adulthood   these study suggest
that intrauterine exposure to maternal diabete may affect the health of more than one generation  
in the intrauterine programming model of maternal gestational diabete in rat by boloker et al   
the offspring develop glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion   which worsen with
age   195    the effect of maternal high fat diet on the health of the offspring have also be study in
nonhuman primate   in female japanese macaque   maternal high fat diet be show to increase liver
triglyceride and increase the risk of develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the offspring   198 199   
these study provide evidence that there be last effect of maternal gestational diabete on the
health of the offspring  
gdm be a complex disease with genetic   environmental   and epigenetic risk factor   therefore  
it be unlikely that a single animal model will accurately represent human gdm   a realistic model may
include animal model with multiple etiology present by gdm   which will likely include both
genetic and environmental factor   furthermore   while large animal and nonhuman primate may
be more similar to human physiologically   study use these animal model remain more limited
compare to those on mouse and rat model   due to feasibility and cost  
nevertheless   animal model have advance the understanding of maternal gestational diabetes
beyond clinical observation alone   furthermore   they may provide a valuable mean to study
intervention strategy target gdm in pregnant woman  
5   conclude remark
the high prevalence of gdm be a major obstacle to achieve improve maternal and child
health   while gdm be a transient condition   its sequalae be lifelong   and gdm research should
be a public health priority   study discuss in this review underscore the gravity of gdm and

introduction
 
hyperglycemia during pregnancy be associate with adverse maternal and neonatal
outcome 1 3 the maternal ramification extend beyond pregnancy as gestational diabetes

woman with hyperglycemia during pregnancy be at increase risk for obesity 3 impair
glucose regulation   and high blood pressure level 5 high risk for adiposity5 among girl
far enhance the vicious cycle of diabetes and obesity over generation  
 
several study aim at prevention of gdm or related adverse outcome have be
undertake   these study have include either diet or physical activity intervention   or both  
in term of gdm prevention   the result have be inconsistent 6 16 a recent meta analysis
conclude   however   that intervention initiate in early pregnancy have the potential to
prevent gdm 17 the efficacy of intervention trial be usually high among participant at
high risk   as see for example in the prevention of t2d 18 19 the large gdm trial have  
however   include also woman at low or medium risk   surprisingly few study have assess
the participant   glucose tolerance at enrollment 7 14
 
while have no significant effect on the incidence of gdm   many intervention trial have
be effective in improve lifestyle   10 12 in reduce the incidence of large for gestational

sample size and randomization
 
we calculate the sample size for the whole radiel trial   include both woman plan
pregnancy and woman already pregnant   assume a gdm incidence of 30   in the control
arm and of 20    in the intervention arm   use a two sided significance level of 0 05   and a
power of 80    we expect a dropout rate of 30    a sample size of at least 1000 woman for

intervention
 
the participant in both study arm visit the study nurse three time during pregnancy in
addition to receive usual antenatal care   the study visit take place on average at 13   23  
and 35 week of gestation   at each study visit   participant in both study arm fill in
questionnaire and undergo a physical examination include anthropometric and blood
pressure measurement as previously describe 20
 
during the study visit   participant in the intervention arm receive structure but
individually modify dietary and physical activity counseling from the study nurse   in
addition   the participant in the intervention arm attend a group nutrition counseling
session give by a dietitian after the first study visit  
 
dietary counseling in the intervention group be base on nordic nutrition
recommendation at the time of the study 22 the counseling focus on food intake  
encourage the use of vegetable   fruit and berry   high fiber whole grain product   low fat
dairy product   vegetable fat high in unsaturated fatty acid   fish and low fat meat product  
and low intake of sugar   and saturate fatty acid rich food   for the intervention arm   the
recommendation for physical activity be a minimum of 150 minute of moderate intensity
 
 
physical activity per week 23 woman with a prepregnancy bmi    30 kg m2 be advise to
avoid weight gain during the first two trimester of pregnancy  
 
the participant in the control group have an equal number of visit to the study nurse as the
participant in the intervention arm   they receive information leaflet on healthy diet and
exercise at enrollment   similar to those provide in public antenatal care  
 
usual antenatal care in finland
 
the public health care system in finland offer all pregnant woman antenatal health care on a
regular basis in municipal maternity clinic at primary health care center   all participant in
our study   both in the intervention and in the control arm   receive this routine care   in
addition to the study visit   at the time of the study   the usual antenatal follow up in primary
care include 10 to 15 visit with a nurse and two to three physician s examination  
follow the national gdm guideline   the woman diagnose with gdm at any time point
during pregnancy   include early pregnancy   receive routine care   include diet and
physical activity recommendation   and self monitoring of blood glucose   in the municipal
maternity clinic 24 in case of repeat fast capillary glucose of   5 5 mmol l or a onehour postprandial value of   7 8 mmol l   the maternity clinic refer the woman to a
maternity hospital for further counseling by a diabetes nurse and to an obstetrician for
assessment regard need of medication  
 
outcome
 
 
the primary outcome of the radiel trial be the total incidence of gdm during pregnancy
  include incidence in early pregnancy I e   at less than 20 week of gestation    the assessed
pre specify secondary outcome be achievement of dietary and physical activity goal  
incidence of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy   I e   gestational hypertension   preeclampsia  
and chronic hypertension   gestational weight gain   gwg    mode of delivery   perinatal
outcome   I e   birth weight of the offspring and rate of large for gestational age   lga  
newborn 20
 
to calculate the incidence of gdm we use the criterion recommend by the finnish current
care guideline where gdm be define as one or more pathological glucose value in a 75 g
2h ogtt during pregnancy 24 the diagnostic threshold be base on those recommend
by the american diabetes association in 2008   fast plasma glucose    5 3 mmol l   one
hour value    10 0 mmol l and two hour value    8 6 mmol l 25 follow the finnish
current care guideline for gdm diagnosis   the participant undergo an ogtt at around
12 to 16 week of gestation   and   if normal   the ogtt be repeat around 24 to 28 week of
gestation unless insulin or metformin treatment be initiate early 24
 
in order to measure the general adherence to the recommend diet   our research group
develop a healthy food intake index   hfii   with the maximum point of 17      which have
later be validate   base on the food frequency questionnaire design for the radiel
study 26 physical activity be assess with self report weekly duration   minute   of leisure
time physical activity   ltpa   that make the participant at least slightly out of breath and
sweat   in addition   participant fill out three day food diary and one week physical
activity diary at baseline and third trimester   we use compendium of physical activity
 
 
code for each activity and correspond meet value when record the physical activity

the definition of preeclampsia be a systolic blood pressure    140 mmhg and or a diastolic
blood pressure    90 mmhg appear for the first time after 20 week of gestation together
with proteinuria    0 3 g 24 hr 28 we define hypertension as chronic if similar blood pressure
level occur before 20 week of gestation   or the participant use antihypertensive
medication   the definition of gestational hypertension be new onset hypertension after 20
week of gestation without proteinuria   we use population specific finnish reference for
birth weight at the time of the trial to evaluate the birth size of the offspring and define lga
as birth weight    2 0 standard deviation   sd   29 the gwg of the participant be calculate
by subtract the self report prepregnancy weight   collect from the antenatal clinic
record   from the weight measure at the third trimester study visit   if the participant do not

discussion
 
among all the high risk woman randomize in the radiel trial in early pregnancy  
include woman with early gdm   we detect no effect of the lifestyle intervention on
dietary intake or physical activity   consequently   relate parameter such as gestational
weight gain and the total incidence of gdm be not affect   furthermore   there be no
difference between the group regard obstetric or perinatal outcome   e g    hypertensive
disorder of pregnancy   birthweight   and rate of lga   these result differ from our previous
finding among a subgroup of participant with normal glucose tolerance in early
pregnancy 21
 
there be no statistically significant difference between the intervention group and the
control group regard change in dietary score and total energy intake   this be in contrast to
some previous intervention   which have report improve dietary quality or diminish
total energy intake 7 10 12 14 30
 
 
as expect   the weekly duration of physical activity decrease throughout pregnancy  
however   the change in duration of physical activity be similar in both group   indicate a
null effect of the intervention on physical activity   in addition   the majority of the participant
do not reach the target of 150 minute of physical activity per week   this be in contrast to
some previous intervention trial which have report high physical activity level in the
intervention group compare with the control group 12 14 16
 
some previous lifestyle intervention trial combine diet and physical activity have
successfully reduce gwg 9 10 12 30 for instance   the combine healthy eating and physical
activity intervention in the dali study succeed in reduce gwg compare to isolated
dietary or physical counseling 14 furthermore   the finnish nelli study succeed in
reduce both birthweight and the rate of lga newborn   with no effect on the rate of
macrosomia 7
 
in some trial   physical activity intervention alone have be effective   three trial  
consist of supervised exercise session three time a week have manage to limit gwg
and reduce the incidence of gdm 13 15 16 in addition   one of these be successful in reduce
the rate of pregnancy induce hypertension   preeclampsia   and macrosomia 15
while another succeed in reduce birthweight 16 in all of these study   the intervention
group be significantly more physically active compare with the control group   we believe
that our physical activity counseling be of notably low intensity and also less intense in
general compare to trial with a positive effect on obstetric or perinatal outcome 13 15 16
 
as show previously   in a subgroup consist of woman with normal ogtt in early
pregnancy   we detect improvement in lifestyle and coincidentally a reduce the risk of
 
 
gdm by 36   21 31 however   in the present high risk cohort we detect no effect of the same
intervention   there be several possible reason for this discrepancy   a significant proportion
  37    of the woman in the present high risk population fulfil the diagnostic criterion for
gdm already in the first half of pregnancy   the fact that all woman with a diagnosis of early
gdm in the intervention and control group receive routine counseling and treatment within
the finnish health care system may have attenuate the difference in effect of the radiel
intervention on lifestyle   obstetric   and perinatal outcome between the intervention and
control group  
 
consider the high standard of usual care   include recommendation on diet and physical
activity for all woman and treatment for woman with both early and later gdm   we
hypothesize that the intensity of the give intervention in the radiel trial   the maximum of
four study visit   include the group session with a dietitian   be probably not high enough
to provide additional benefit for participant in the intervention group  
 
insulin resistance increase as pregnancy progress and lifestyle intervention usually aim at
prevent gdm mainly through attempt to reduce insulin resistance which also have a
positive impact on insulin secretion   consider the heterogeneous nature of gdm   it be
likely that the potential of any lifestyle intervention to prevent gdm be variable   depend
on the type and degree of impairment in glucose metabolism in the study population   in our
study   a high proportion of the participant have a pathological ogtt already in early
pregnancy   potentially suggest a more severe form of derangement in glucose metabolism  
it be possible that the predisposition to develop early gdm be strong in our study
population   due to both genetic and or environmental factor   and thus a mild to moderate
 
 
intensity lifestyle intervention initiate during pregnancy be not sufficient to have a
significant impact on glucose metabolism or other obstetric or perinatal outcome  
 
in order to be able to assess the effect of a lifestyle intervention during pregnancy on gdm
risk   glucose tolerance must be assess before study inclusion   to our knowledge   most
lifestyle intervention trial aim at prevention of gdm or obesity relate outcome have not
test the participant for gdm in early pregnancy   exception be the nelli study   in
which about 28    of the assess woman be exclude due to pathologic ogtt result at
inclusion 7 and the dali study   in which the corresponding rate be 27    14
 
many prevention trial   include the radiel trial   have utilize national gdm criterion   the
use of variable diagnostic threshold and testing time for the diagnosis of gdm far
complicate the comparison of result from different study   in addition   difference in
national treatment guideline for gdm might lead to substantial variation in the impact of
additional intervention compare to routine care  
 
the strength of this study be the characterization of the participant at baseline   include
assessment of early pregnancy glucose metabolism   this add valuable information for future
study on timing of prevention of gdm and its adverse effect   the small sample size be a
limitation as it do not allow detection of difference in relatively infrequent adverse
obstetric and perinatal outcome   furthermore   our sample size and the fact that not all
participant attend the early pregnancy ogtt prevent a more detailed exploration of the
early gdm subgroup   in addition   the apply diet and physical activity measurement
method might have be too crude to detect small change   physical activity be self  
 
 
report and not base on e g    accelerometer   the return rate of food and physical activity
diary be low   and we lack diary datum concern the second trimester  
 
one might argue that the duration of lifestyle intervention during pregnancy be too short to
prevent gdm and related outcome and that intervention should be initiate already in the
pre pregnancy period   we stress the need for future study explore the efficacy of gdm
prevention intervention initiate in the pre pregnancy period  
 
in conclusion   many of the high risk woman develop gdm already in early pregnancy  
the combine dietary and physical activity counseling initiate in early pregnancy in the
radiel trial in woman at high risk of gdm do not affect dietary intake   physical activity  
or obstetric and perinatal outcome   these result differ from our previous sub study
include only woman with normal glucose tolerance in early pregnancy

gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be define as a glucose tolerance disorder with
onset or first recognition during pregnancy   1    gdm be the most common metabolic disorder of pregnancy that occur in 5 to 25   of all pregnancy   depend on the ethnicity and
population study   the screening method use   and the diagnostic test employ   2    in
2019   20 4 million of 129 5 million live birth be affect by hyperglycemia in pregnancy  
and 83 6   be affect by gdm   which show the importance of this complication   3   
gdm be diagnose if at least one of the threshold value be meet   fast glucose level of
5 1 6 9 mmol l   92 125 mg dl    at first hour   10 0 mmol l   180 mg dl   and at second
hour 8 5 11 0 mmol l   153 199 mg dl    4   
the importance of this problem and prevent gdm be emphasize by the increase
possibility of either maternal or fetal complication in pregnancy with gdm compare to
non complicated pregnancy   5    pregnant woman and their unborn child have a high
risk of adverse outcome   miscarriage   preterm birth   preeclampsia   cesarean section   macrosomia to shoulder dystocia and trauma during delivery   asymmetrical intrauterine growth
retardation   aiugr    stillbirth   neonatal hyperbilirubinemia   hypoglycemia   hypocalcemia
and polycythemia   respiratory distress syndrome   and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy    6 7   
it have be prove that gdm be also connect with antenatal depression more so than
in normal pregnancy   5    woman with gdm be also at high risk for the development
of gdm in subsequent pregnancy   type 2 diabetes mellitus   t2 dm    and cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality in future life   8 9    their offspring also have a significantly increase risk of develop foster obesity   metabolic syndrome   and impaired glucose
metabolism in later life   10

an adaptation of maternal metabolism with high nutritional requirement to improve fetal growth be observe   9    insulin secretion increase in the first trimester of pregnancy   but decrease insulin sensitivity be observe in the second and third trimester   11   
it be suggest that it be cause by placental production of hormone such as leptin   progesterone   cortisol   estrogen   placental growth hormone and lactogen   which increase insulin
resistance   whereby woman s insulin secretion be insufficient   12    it be believe that prepregnancy decrease maternal insulin sensitivity and pre conception insulin resistance   impair insulin response observe during pregnancy   and dysfunction of insulin produce
β cell be the pathophysiological background of gdm development   11    however   moderate insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia be observe during physiological pregnancy  
which also provide suitable sufficient nutrient supply for the metabolic need of the
rapidly grow fetus  
2   risk factor for gdm
epidemiological study have identify several risk factor associate with develop
gdm   most of those risk factor be strictly connect with insulin sensitivity or β cell of
pancrea function to synthesize insulin   5   
although many genetic and environmental factor may contribute to develop
gdm   maternal obesity and nutritional insufficiency be vital factor that make gdm one
of pregnancy s most important clinical complication   13    it have be prove that one of
the most substantial risk factor be obesity before pregnancy   define as body mass index
  bmi     30 kg m2     14    therefore   it be understandable that the prevalence of gdm in a
give population be similar to that of t2 dm   african   hispanic   and some asian female
population be more likely to develop gdm than caucasian woman   15 16   
other risk factor include excess weight gain during pregnancy   advanced maternal
age   and gdm in previous pregnancy   17    the finding of the other author also highlight
the association between increase gestational weight gain and the risk of gdm   18   
it have be publish that high dietary fat and low carbohydrate intake during pregnancy appear to be associate with a high risk for gdm independent of prepregnancy bmi   18   
it be suggest that some genetic factor may increase the risk of gdm   there be
no typical genetic factor that could be responsible for gdm pathogenesis   it have be
publish that some variant in several essential gene be correlate with the pathogenesis of insulin resistance   include the receptor of prolactin and melatonin   19 20   
abnormal production or secretion of adipokine in insulin resistance be also observe   the
dysregulation of the metabolism of several adipokine may play an important role in the
pathogenesis of gdm   21 22  
polycystic ovary syndrome   pcos    with metabolic and hormonal dysfunction   also
increase the risk of gdm   however   it seem to be relate to obesity and increase maternal
age rather than to pcos itself   23   
the lifestyle factor in early pregnancy   include nutritional factor   appear to be
important in the pathogenesis of gdm   24    it be suggest that most of these factor have a
prolong influence on patient   imply that lifestyle modification should be introduce
before pregnancy   not only during its duration   25   
finally   the risk factor for develop gdm can be divide into modifiable and
non modifiable factor   the age   ethnicity   pcos   gdm in previous pregnancy   and
genetic factor such as a family history of diabetes can be classify as non modifiable
risk factor of gdm   and the modifiable one be cigarette smoking by pregnant patient
and or their parent   pre pregnancy bmi    30 kg m2    low physical activity before and
during pregnancy   and many dietary factor   5   
3   material and method

the follow type of article   population base study   review   systematic review  
meta analysis   and clinical trial   the present article be a narrative review   and we do
not perform a systematic review and could therefore not perform a meta analysis  
4   prevention of gdm
interfere in patient   lifestyle in diet and physical activity and glucose level control
can help reduce complication of pregnancy observe in gdm patient   the essential
factor be close monitoring of glucose level   fast glucose level should be maintain
below 5 mmol l   90 mg dl   and 1 h after main meal below 7 8 mmol l   140 mg dl   
dietary control be the first line of treatment of gdm   26    if nutritional control be not adequate   pharmacotherapy be introduce   in addition to necessary diet and pharmacotherapy  
other primary action be also need  
currently   there be no systematized strategy for gdm prevention   it be believe that
due to the parallel in the pathogenesis and risk factor of gdm and t2 dm   it be likely
that agent that be effective in prevent t2 dm may also be effective in prevent
gdm   these factor include eat pattern   physical activity   a decline in obesity rate  
and weight gain during pregnancy   it be important to identify population factor to reduce
rise gdm rate   as be the case with t2 dm   27   
evidence show that weight loss be not recommend during pregnancy   even in
obese woman    suggest adequate weight and nutritional control before conception
and between pregnancy   therefore   in some group of patient with diagnose insulin
resistance   such as pcos or metabolic syndrome patient   in the prevention of pregnancy
complication   include gdm   it be suggest to introduce metformin therapy   glueck
et al   observe a 10 fold decrease in the incidence of gdm in this group of patient   28   
however   daily administration of 3 g of metformin in non diabetic obese pregnant patient
from early pregnancy to delivery do not reduce the incidence of gdm   29   
it seem that the important issue in gdm prevention be the implementation of proper
dietary pattern and appropriate physical activity   and a combination of diet and lifestyle
modification be consider   in recent year   a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity of
other factor   such as fiber   myoinositol   and probiotic   have also be observe  
a beneficial effect of micronutrient such as vitamin d   iron   and selenium on glucose
metabolism have be note  
the study aim to review the scientific evidence on nutritional prevention strategy   include diet and supplementation of some substance such as probiotic   micro macroelement   fiber   myoinositol   and vitamin that may be effective in reduce the
risk of gdm   figure 1

it have be suggest that pregnancy provide an opportunity for healthcare professional to modify lifestyle pattern towards acquire healthy habit both for the
individual patient and for society   30    it have be prove that introduce a healthy
eat pattern   such as the mediterranean diet   and reduce consumption of iron rich
food   sugar sweeten cola   potatoe   fatty food   and sweet may decrease the frequency

to the control group and 434 be assign to the intervention group   which rely on
the meddiet with the addition of pistachio and virgin olive oil   the intervention be
reveal to be effective with a 17 1   risk of develop gdm compare to 23 4   in the
control group   p    0 012    additionally   in the intervention group   there be significantly
low level of fast blood glycemia and hba1c at checkup at 24 28 and 36 38 week of
gestation than in the control group   in the control group   when gdm be diagnose   the
woman be more likely to require insulin therapy   32    compare to the intervention

study where intervention recognize only the meddiet without additional ingredient
enrichment and observe no difference in gdm prevalence in the study group compare
to the previous study   this study also analyze the influence of the meddiet on woman
diagnose with gdm during research   the author conclude that intervention could
reduce perinatal complication similar to woman with normal glucose tolerance   53    those
complication be probably associate with inflammatory process and or organism
response to hyperglycemia and inadequate control of glycemia   it could be responsible for
the effectiveness of the meddiet   which have antioxidant and anti inflammatory property  
and the potential to improve insulin sensitivity  
in a study conduct in the university hospital of granada   spain   a protective

by dietary or mixed approach intervention   they suggest a trend towards a beneficial
effect in patient of mainly diet base intervention   with the potential to significantly
reduce the risk of gdm only in obese and overweight woman   54    however   diet base
intervention seem to prevent gdm   this can be due to the follow cause   personalize
diet and ingredient   change in weight gain during pregnancy   and the effect of dietary
supplement   there be no evidence that dietary intervention significantly reduce the
rate of preterm delivery   however   they reduce the cesarean section rate   the rate of the
induction of labor   and the rate of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia   55 56   
4 2   physical activity
it have be publish that dietary intervention can decrease the risk of develop
gdm and the percentage of macrosomic newborn bear in obese pregnant patient   but
physical activity intervention do not have the same effect   57    however   the american
dietetic association and the american nutrition society state that woman who exercise
during pregnancy gain significantly less fat and that moderate exercise may reduce the
risk of gdm   58    in two meta analysis   a 28 31   reduction in the risk of gdm and a
mean difference of about 1 1 kg in gestational weight gain between the study and control
group use structured   low   to moderate intensity exercise program that contain an
aerobic component be observe   59 60   
moreover   when the exercise program be carry out throughout pregnancy   the
decrease in the risk of gdm seem to be even great   36     60    however   han et al   
in their study   compare two group   first   with supervised exercise session and exercise
advice and second   with regular daily activity   and do not observe a significant difference
in gdm risk between these group   61    when interpret these observation   we have
to remember limitation such as no assessment of physical activity outside the program  
no standardized intervention   difference in study design and intervention content   an
overall a not very considerable number of study   and limited adherence to intervention
protocol in some analysis   26   
4 3   combine diet and physical activity
it have be suggest that the good effect in the prevention of gdm can be achieve
by combine exercise and diet   however   some study show no positive effect in
patient with a mixed approach that combine diet and physical activity   42 54    it seem
that it may also be relate to insufficient patient compliance with the recommendation
regard physical activity   the most extensive study base on both diet and modification
of lifestyle in pregnancy   the limit study   find no benefit of intervention for gdm and
other maternal outcome   include weight gain during pregnancy   55    however   in the
study publish by thangaratinam   the combination of dietary recommendation and
physical activity have be show to significantly decrease the risk of preeclampsia by 26  
and the risk of have a large for gestational age   lga   infant by 27   among healthy
pregnant patient or those who be overweight or obese in comparison to non obese

may be a result of include intervention early at 13 3 week of gestation   median   and
the requirement of inclusion   which be high risk pregnancy with a bmi of   30 kg m2
or gdm in previous pregnancy   it should be note that neonatal and other maternal
outcome such as hypertensive disorder   cesarean section rate   and fetal macrosomia be
similar in both group   the conclusion from this study be very promising and indicate
that the prevalence of gdm can be decrease by lifestyle intervention   however   research

recently   the role of intestinal microbiota in regulate metabolism have become a hot
topic of research   thus   microbiota may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of obesity
and may also significantly affect glucose homeostasis   64

a placebo   the researcher observe the frequency of gdm   13    diet probiotic   versus
36    diet placebo   and 34    control    p    0 003   accord to the author   this could be
explain by the fact that consumption of probiotic may reduce the risk of gdm because
these microorganism can affect the intestinal microflora by modify food polysaccharide
fermentation and improve intestinal barrier function   65    luoto et al   also note the
ability of probiotic to modulate inflammatory pathway   there be no significant difference in pregnancy duration and outcome   mean birth weight of the newborn   or 5th
min   apgar score and weight gain through the first 24 month of life between group   64   
in a recently publish study   homayouni et al   also suggest that probiotic efficiency
may be relate to change in the degradation of polysaccharide   the second postulate
mechanism include increase intestinal permeability induce by naturalization of the intestinal biotome and secretion of pro inflammatory mediator   which contribute to limit
local and systemic inflammation   result in the strengthening of the immune system   66

correlate with an improvement in glucose and lipid metabolism in pregnant patient and
could decrease the risk of gdm   61 68

the mechanism of action of reduce gdm risk by vitamin d be not fully understand   it
can be an effect of multiple mechanism   such as stimulation of insulin receptor expression

conduct further study to confirm the relationship of iron concentration with the occurrence
of gdm

it be postulate that in the prevention of gdm   some intervention   such as adherence
to a diet as healthy as the meddiet   optimal physical activity   supplement vitamin d  
fiber   myoinositol   probiotic contain lactobacillus rhamnosus   and bifidobacterium
lactis could become standard practice   the effectiveness of application of several of the
method mention above simultaneously should also be test   as it could be more
effective than apply they individually   most intervention perform during pregnancy
be not entirely successful in gdm prevention   and although there be evidence that some
supplement can be beneficial   these trial demonstrate only limited evidence   however  
pre pregnancy dietary pattern appear to reduce the risk of gdm   program that introduce
appropriate dietary pattern for woman before pregnancy appear to be the first line of
gdm prevention  
it be necessary to emphasize the difficulty in draw clear conclusion base on the
analyze publication due to the heterogeneity of the evaluate study   heterogeneous
group of patient from different geographic region   and variation in the element of
the intervention   such as duration   intensity and frequency   non standardized care in the
control group   and inconsistent definition of gdm  
although several prospective study have reveal a correlation between some nutrient or dietary pattern and the prevalence of gdm   further study be need to evaluate

for clinical risk factor and   among at risk woman   testing for abnormal glucose tolerance that
be usually   but not invariably   mild and asymptomatic   gdm appear to result from the same

when they be not pregnant   thus   gdm provide a unique opportunity to study the early
pathogenesis of diabetes and to develop intervention to prevent the disease  
historical perspective
for more than a century   it have be know that diabete antedating pregnancy can have severe adverse effect on fetal and neonatal outcome   1    as early as in the 1940   it be recognize that
woman who develop diabetes year after pregnancy have experience abnormally high fetal and neonatal mortality   2    by the
1950 the term   gestational diabetes   be apply to what be
think to be a transient condition that affect fetal outcome
adversely   then abate after delivery   3    in the 1960s   o sullivan
find that the degree of glucose intolerance during pregnancy
be relate to the risk of develop diabete after pregnancy   he
propose criterion for the interpretation of oral glucose tolerance
test   ogtts   during pregnancy that be fundamentally statistical   establish cut off value    approximately 2 standard deviation    for diagnose glucose intolerance during pregnancy   4   
in the 1980 those cut off point be adapt to modern method for measure glucose and apply to the modern definition
of gestational diabetes    glucose intolerance with onset or first
recognition during pregnancy   5    while base on o sullivan s
value for predict diabete after pregnancy   the diagnosis of
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   also identify pregnancy at
increase risk for perinatal morbidity   6 8   and long term obesity
and glucose intolerance in offspre   9 11   
population perspective
clinical detection of gdm be carry out to identify pregnancy at increase risk for perinatal morbidity and mortality  
available datum do not identify a threshold of maternal glycemia
at which such risk begin or increase rapidly   a multinational
study   the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome study  
be underway to explore this issue in a large multiethnic cohort  
in the absence of a define glucose threshold for perinatal risk

of gdm   a condition that be generally asymptomatic   involve
screen in 2 sequential step   table 1 and 2    follow by
administration of a 2   or 3 hour ogtt   table 3   to woman determined to be at risk by screen   woman with very high clinical
risk characteristic may be diagnose with probable pregestational   preexisting   diabete base on the criterion provide in table
4   when the diagnostic criterion for a 3 hour ogtt present in
table 3 be apply to a group of caucasian woman in toronto  
approximately 7   have gdm   6    the frequency of gdm may vary
among ethnic group   higher in group with increase prevalence
of hyperglycemia    13 16   and with the use of different diagnostic
criterion   high when low glucose threshold be apply and vice
versa    4    nonetheless   all approach to gdm detection pinpoint
   and thereby allow diagnosis of    woman with glucose tolerance
in the upper end of the population distribution during pregnancy  
a small minority of those woman have glucose level that would
be diagnostic of diabetes outside of pregnancy   table 4    the great
majority have low glucose level   both group impart to their
offspre an increase risk of perinatal morbidity and long term
obesity and diabete that appear to be relate at least in part to
fetal overnutrition in utero   they also incur for themselves a risk
of diabetes after pregnancy that be the main focus of this paper  
etiology and pathogenesis
normal pregnancy
a detailed discussion of glucose regulation in pregnancy be beyond
the scope of this paper   however   2 point be important for the
discussion that follow   first   pregnancy be normally attend by
progressive insulin resistance that begin near mid pregnancy and
progress through the third trimester to level that approximate
the insulin resistance see in individual with type 2 diabetes  
the insulin resistance appear to result from a combination of
increase maternal adiposity and the insulin desensitize effect
of hormonal product of the placenta   the fact that insulin resistance rapidly abate follow delivery suggest that the major
contributor to this state of resistance be placental hormone   the
second point be that pancreatic β cell normally increase their insulin secretion to compensate for the insulin resistance of pregnancy

gestational diabete
gdm be a form of hyperglycemia   in general   hyperglycemia result
from an insulin supply that be inadequate to meet tissue demand
for normal blood glucose regulation   study conduct during late

they appear to have evolve type 1 diabetes   which come to clinical attention through routine glucose screening during pregnancy  
the frequency of anti islet cell and anti gad antibody detect in
gdm tend to parallel ethnic trend in the prevalence of type 1 diabete outside of pregnancy   patient with anti islet cell or anti gad

as deafness   in both instance   onset tend to occur at an early age
relative to other form of nonimmune diabetes   e g    type 2 diabetes   describe below    and patient tend not to be obese or insulin
resistant   both feature point to abnormality in the regulation
of β cell mass and or function   indeed   detail metabolic study
have reveal abnormality in glucose mediate insulin secretion in
some form of mody   32    mutation that cause several subtype of
mody have be find in woman with gdm   these include mutation in gene code for    a   glucokinase   mody 2    29   33 35     b  
hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α   mody 3    29     c   and insulin promoter factor 1   mody 4    29    together   these monogenic form
of gdm account for less than 10   of gdm case   29   33 36    they
likely represent case of preexist diabete that be first detect
by routine glucose screening during pregnancy  
insulin resistance   β cell dysfunction   and gdm
the majority of woman with gdm appear to have β cell dysfunction that occur on a background of chronic insulin resistance  
as note above   pregnancy normally induce quite marked insulin resistance   this physiological insulin resistance also occur in
woman with gdm   however   it occur on a background of chronic
insulin resistance to which the insulin resistance of pregnancy be
partially additive   as a result   pregnant woman with gdm tend to
have even great insulin resistance than normal pregnant woman  
difference in whole body insulin sensitivity tend to be small in
the third trimester   owe to the mark effect of pregnancy itself
on insulin resistance   nonetheless   precise and direct measure of
insulin sensitivity apply during the third trimester have identify   in woman with gdm   exaggerated resistance to insulin s ability to stimulate glucose utilization   17   18   and to suppress both
glucose production   17   18   and fatty acid level   17    after delivery  
when the acquire insulin resistance of pregnancy abate   woman
who have gdm end up   on average   with considerably great insulin resistance than normal woman   this finding   which have be
consistent across study in which whole body insulin sensitivity
have be measure directly   22   23   25   26   37 40    indicate that
most woman who develop gdm have chronic insulin resistance  
sequential measurement of insulin sensitivity perform in the
same woman before pregnancy   early in the second trimester   and
the journal of clinical investigation
 
in the third trimester have document insulin resistance in both
lean and obese woman who go on to develop gdm   18   24   
only a small number of potential biochemical mediator of the
chronic insulin resistance that frequently accompany gdm and
that likely contribute to the high risk of type 2 diabete have be
examine   it be likely that there be not a single underlie biochemical
etiology   woman with gdm tend to be obese   so mechanism promote obesity and or link obesity to insulin resistance be likely
to play a role   small study have reveal increase circulate level
of leptin   41   and the inflammatory marker tnf α   42   and c reactive protein   43   and decrease level of adiponectin   44   45   in woman
with gdm   increase content of fat in liver   46   and muscle   47   have
also be report in woman with previous gestational diabetes   all
of these finding be consistent with the current understanding of
some potential cause of obesity relate insulin resistance  
defect in the binding of insulin to its receptor in skeletal muscle
do not appear to be involve in the exaggerated insulin resistance
of gdm   48    alteration in the insulin signal pathway   49 52   
abnormal subcellular localization of glut4 transporter   53   
reduce expression of pparγ   49    increase expression of the membrane glycoprotein pc 1   51    and reduced insulin mediate glucose
transport   52   53   have be find in skeletal muscle or fat cell
of woman with gdm or a history thereof compare with normal
woman   whether any of these defect be primary or the result of more
fundamental defect in insulin action be currently unknown   give
that gdm represent a cross section of young woman with glucose
intolerance   mechanism that lead to chronic insulin resistance in
gdm be likely to be as varied as they be in the general population  
it have long be think   and teach   that gdm develop in
woman who can not increase their insulin secretion when face
with the increase insulin need impose by late pregnancy   serial
study of woman who develop gdm do not support that concept  
as illustrate in figure 1   insulin secretion in obese woman who
develop gdm can increase considerably over week or month
in association with the acquire insulin resistance of pregnancy  
however   the increase occur along an insulin sensitivity secretion curve that be approximately 50   low   I e    50   less insulin
for any degree of insulin resistance   than that of normal woman  
these short term response appear to occur on a background of
long term deterioration of β cell function that   over year   lead to
progressive hyperglycemia and diabetes   see   link to diabete after
pregnancy    below    longitudinal study of lean and obese woman
before pregnancy   at the beginning of the second trimester   and
in the third trimester also reveal an increase in insulin secretion
in association with the acquire insulin resistance of pregnancy
  18   24    however   the increase be less than that which occur in

tance in individual with gdm   these small but elegant physiological study reveal that the limitation in insulin secretion in
woman with gdm be not necessarily fix   rather   in at least some
of they   insulin secretion be low relative to their insulin sensitivity
but responsive to change sensitivity   one approach to the prevention of diabetes after gdm have take advantage of this responsiveness   discuss below in   link to diabete after pregnancy    
very little be know about the genetic of gdm in woman with
chronic insulin resistance   the few study that have be do
have compare allele frequency of candidate gene in woman
with and without gdm   with no selection for specific phenotypic
subtype of gdm   variant that differ in frequency between

pregnancy   only approximately 10   of patient have diabete soon
after delivery   58    incident case appear to occur at a relatively constant rate during the first 10 year thereafter   57    and the few study that have be conduct over a period of more than 10 year

introduction
 
material and method
 
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be define
as carbohydrate intolerance of variable severity  
with an onset or first recognition during pregnancy   1 7    it represent the most common metabolic
complication of pregnancy   and be associate with
maternal   hypertension   pre eclampsia   caesarean
section   infection   polyhydramnio   and fetal morbidity   macrosomia   birth trauma   hypoglycemia  
hypocalcemia   hypomagnesemia   hyperbilirubinemia   respiratory distress syndrome   polycythemia  
  8 11    moreover   woman with gdm have a considerably elevate risk for impaired glucose tolerance
  igt   and type 2 diabetes in the year follow
pregnancy   11   12    woman with gdm be up to six
time more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than
woman with normal glucose tolerance in pregnancy   13   14    child of woman with gdm be more
likely to be obese and have igt and diabetes in
childhood and early adulthood   11   15   
the prevalence of gdm   as report in different
study   vary between 1   and 14   in all pregnancy depend on the genetic characteristic
and environment of the population under study  
screening and diagnostic method employ as
well as on prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus
  3   10   16   17    the traditional and most often report risk factor for gdm be old age   high
maternal age    prepregnancy obesity   high parity   family history of diabetes   fhd    especially in
first degree relative    previous delivery of a macrosomic infant and previous obstetric outcome
history   e g   previous history of gdm   congenital
malformation   caesarean section    1   2   5   10   18  
20    other potential risk factor be still controversial   low or high birth weight   short stature   smoking   multiparity   physical inactivity   excess weight
gain in pregnancy and socioeconomic factor   education level   occupation and monthly household
income    1   2   5 7   
with the growth of the economy and the transition to a more sedentary lifestyle in turkey   the
prevalence of diabetes   obesity and metabolic
syndrome be rise dramatically   21 23    the prevalence of diabetes have increase from 7 2   to
13 7   in the last 12 year   23    in turkey   there be
not enough datum about prevalence of gdm and
associate risk factor   in the previous three study   10   24   25    the prevalence of gdm have be
investigate   but the risk factor for gdm have
not be systematically research in turkey   to
our knowledge   the present study be the first one
about the relationship of gdm in turkey  
the objective of this study be to assess the prevalence of gdm accord to the carpenter and coustan   cc   criterion in the trabzon region and to examine its association with a number of risk factor in
a sample of the turkish pregnant population  
 
the study be carry out in the central province of trabzon city from may 2009 to april 2011  
the central province of trabzon city   locate in
the northeastern part of turkey   include a population of 230 399 people   the sample size be

this research represent a population base
study of gdm in which the prevalence of gdm

analyze for the first time   also   the present study
be the first study conduct in trabzon region accord to cc criterion   in addition   in the present

time in turkey  
gestational diabetes mellitus be a common
health problem and its prevalence be increase
globally   gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence
worldwide vary from 1   to 14   of all pregnancy
  3   10   16   29    the prevalence may be variable in
different region of a country   8    high prevalence
rate have be report in study from australia
  indian bear 15    chinese 13 9    and the united
state   zuni indians 14 3     30    these difference may reflect the effect of dynamic interaction
among genetic   demographic   sociocultural and
 
730  
 
economic factor   statistical variation be partly
due to difference in the screening method and
diagnostic criterion use   8   30    in previous report about prevalence of gdm in turkey between
1995 and 2007   the prevalence be find to be
between 1 23   and 6 5    10   24   25    in a previous study perform by we from 1995 to 1997  
we find that the prevalence of gdm in the central province of trabzon city be 1 23   accord
to national diabetes data group   nddg   criterion
  10    in the present study   the prevalence of gdm
be find to be 4 8    the estimate prevalence
of gdm be comparable   be moderately high
by international standard   also   in the present
study   we detect that the gdm prevalence be
3 1   accord to nddg diagnostic criterion   indicate that gdm prevalence have prominently
  approximately 3 fold   increase in the trabzon
region over the past 15 year  
interestingly   in our study   gdm prevalence be
find to be 12 3   for pregnant woman with normal gct but with high risk for gdm   a prevalence
of 0 4   in all pregnant woman    therefore   we
recommend screen to these pregnant woman
for gdm  
maternal age be strongly associate with gdm  
in many study   it be report that prevalence
of gdm increase with maternal age   8   16   24

31   32    in our study   the prevalence of gdm increase markedly with maternal age   from about
0 7   among people in the    25 year old age group
to 9 5   among people    35 year old   the or for
gdm significantly increase in    30 year old pregnant woman   or    17 1 in the 30 34 year old age
group    indicate that the optimum pregnancy
period for reduce risk of gdm be below the age
of 30 year  
although cigarette smoking be positively associate with hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance in
some study   1   33   34    the association between
cigarette smoking and gdm have be little investigate   1    current smoking be a significant independent risk factor for gdm   35 37    in other study  
a significant association between gdm and smoking have not be observe   32   38    in contrast to
previous study   in the present study   we find an
inverse association between smoking and gdm  
gestational diabetes mellitus be significantly less
frequent in current smoker than in former smoker and non smoker   logistic regression analysis
indicate that the risk of gdm be significantly
increase in former smoker   3 1 fold    this condition may be explain by the fact that cessation of
smoke usually result in weight gain and alteration in adipocyte metabolism   39    first   lipoprotein lipase activity   which be the most important lipolytic enzyme in the adipocyte   increase   in turn  
body weight may increase   also   this trend might
be due to the effect of cigarette on depress the
appetite   in the present study   our datum reveal
that turkish pregnant former smoker be heavy and old than current smoker and nonsmoker   also   weight gain in pregnancy in former smoker be high than that in nonsmoker  
many study have report that prepregnancy bmi and obesity be associate with a high
prevalence of gdm and independent risk factor
of gdm   6   11   13   16   18   29   30   40 42    obesity also be strongly link to the development of
gdm   5   7    in a population base cohort study
of about 97 000 singleton birth   obese woman
have a 3 fold high risk of develop gdm than
non obese woman   43    the rate of obesity be rise dramatically worldwide   include in turkey  
consequently increase the rate of gdm   7   21   
in addition   an increase prevalence of obesity in
trabzon city be likely to contribute to the increase
in prevalence of gdm   in our study   prepregnancy
bmi and obesity have a strong positive association
with the prevalence of gdm   prepregnancy obesity
be find to be a significant risk factor for gdm  
multiple logistic regression analysis indicate that
obese woman     30 kg m2   be up to 60 time
more likely to develop gdm than woman with
a bmi    18 5 kg m2   these finding be in agreement with the result of many other author

some study show a significant association between excessive weight gain in pregnancy     8 kg   and gdm   31   35   44    some other
study do not corroborate this association   45  
46    the difference in the result might also be
explain by the time interval in which weight
gain be measure   1    in the present study  
we find an association between weight gain
and gdm   the risk of gdm be significantly increase 4 7 fold in woman with excessive weight
gain in pregnancy  
woman with a previous   or past   history of
gdm have increase risk of develop gdm in
subsequent pregnancy   7   47    previous gdm be
also one of the strong predictor for gdm   5  
48   49    in our study   we observe that the prevalence of gdm be strongly correlate with past
history of gdm   prevalence of gdm in woman with
a past history of gdm be 50    we find that   as
compare with woman without a previous history
of gdm   woman with a previous history of gdm
have 84 fold increase risk of develop gdm  
there be a positive relationship between fhd

of gdm   3   8   11   16   29   30   41   42   49    family history of diabetes be a strong independent risk factor for gdm   8   11   41   49    di cianni et al   report that gdm be more prevalent in woman with

yang et al   report that pregnant woman with
a fhd in first degree relative have an approximately 2 fold increase risk for gdm as compare
with whose without fhd in first degree relative
  11    in the present study   we find a high prevalence of gdm in woman with fhd in first degree
relative   p    0 001    in logistic regression analysis   woman with fhd in first degree relative have
a 4 5 fold increase risk of develop gdm   compare with woman without fhd in first degree
relative   also   in our study   we find a high
prevalence of gdm in woman with at least one
high risk factor for gdm   14 5     as compare
with woman have no risk factor   our finding
be consist with some study in the literature
  16   41   50   51   
several study have report that gdm increase the fetal risk of macrosomia   maternal risk
of pre eclampsia and polyhydramnio   4   10   16

polyhydramnio   development of preeclampsia  
the mean birth weight of deliver baby and
cesarean delivery be significantly high for
pregnant woman with gdm than those without
gdm   our finding be consistent with the finding in the literature  
the main disadvantage of the present study
be that it be a local   regional study   therefore   the
number of participant be low   in addition   we

could not use other diagnostic criterion for gdm  
therefore   different gdm screening method could
not be compare with each other  
in conclusion   in this prospective study of pregnant woman follow a universal screening test
which firstly examine various risk factor   we
find that gdm be a moderate common pregnancy complication in trabzon city   we find that
the prevalence of gdm as define by cc criterion
be moderate   4 8    in the turkish pregnant woman live in trabzon province   the prevalence of
gdm have obviously increase in the trabzon region during the last 15 year   commonly recognize risk factor include old age   prepregnancy obesity   fhd in first degree relative and past
history of gdm be valid for our urban turkish
population   also   excessive weight gain in pregnancy and cessation of cigarette smoking be
observe to be nontraditional risk factor of gdm  
in addition   the present study suggest that the
increase prevalence may lead to poor obstetric
and neonatal outcome   this study demonstrate
that our finding lead we to recommend universal
screen for gdm in trabzon city   study with
large sample size and with long term follow up
be need to define health benefit of different screening method in pregnancy   require
precaution include effective public health education   balanced nutrition and physical activity

this be   to our knowledge   the ﬁrst randomize control lifestyle intervention trial
that have succeed in reduce the overall
incidence of gdm among high risk pregnant woman   as a result of the combine
moderate physical activity and diet intervention   the overall incidence of gdm be
reduce by 39    the participant in the
intervention group increase their physical
activity and improve their dietary quality
during pregnancy   indicate a real effort
to change their overall lifestyle in a healthy direction   by contrast   the control group
participant do not increase their physical
activity or improve the dietary quality in a
signiﬁcant manner   average weight gain
during pregnancy be modest in both
group   other maternal and neonatal outcome   include birth size   be similar in
both group  
the result of this lifestyle intervention
study in pregnant woman who be at high
risk of gdm be encouraging and be similar to ﬁnding from major type 2 diabetes
prevention study   18 19    it be worth
keep in mind that since the woman
participate in the radiel be woman
who be at high risk for gdm   the
woman in the control group also receive
general health advice   for example   in
weight control at antenatal clinic   therefore   the control group be more of a miniintervention group than a pure control
group   we believe that in an unselected
high risk population the impact of this
kind of lifestyle intervention could be
even more pronounced  
previous type 2 diabetes prevention
study   include the finnish diabetes prevention study   18   and the diabetes prevention program   19    have show that the
prevention of type 2 diabetes be possible
and feasible by lifestyle intervention   however   these study have be criticize for
be too labor intensive and therefore
not directly applicable to a primary health
care set   36    the radiel protocol and
design be much less resource and labor

the dietary score apply in the study
show a signiﬁcant but small improvement in the adherence to dietary recommendation in the intervention
group   this kind of holistic approach
have prove fruitful in the prevention
and management of type 2 diabetes
  37    even a small change in dietary
choice can be important when apply
at a population level   38    the intervention group also increase their leisure
time physical activity level and gain
less weight than the woman in the control group from baseline to the second
trimester when the gdm diagnosis be
set   despite the fact that only a small
proportion of the woman in the intervention group reach the physical activity goal   and the difference in weight
gain be modest between the group   it
be obvious that the individual change in
lifestyle do not need to be large   but
together they have a beneﬁcial effect
on the reduction of the incidence of
gdm  
since the radiel be perform in a
white population   the validity of generalize the result need to be discuss   however   we suggest that it be
possible to generalize the result   at
least to some extent   since the study
protocol be simple and modiﬁable  
and thus easy to implement in the different society and ethnic group  
 
control group

focus on a select group of
woman with a high risk for the development of gdm may be consider a potential weakness   since   for example  
overweight woman at the population
level may form a great proportion of
woman in whom gdm will develop than
the obese population alone   on the
other hand   if overweight woman or
woman with previous macrosomia have
be recruit to the trial   the heterogeneity of the study group would have
be increase markedly   this could
also have have effect on the intervention result   24 26 28 29    we believe
that in the radiel we have be able
to identify a real high risk group that be
also the most likely to beneﬁt from a
lifestyle intervention during pregnancy   our study ﬁnding show that
modest change in several lifestyleassociate factor have a large overall
effect on gdm risk   however   a large
sample size would probably have be
need to see an effect on other maternal or neonatal outcome  
we have show that gdm can be prevent in a high risk population by simple  
easily applicable lifestyle intervention  
our ﬁnding suggest that individualize
lifestyle intervention should be initiate
in early pregnancy in high risk woman
and continue throughout pregnancy  
these result be unique and highly promising   prevent gdm may have major
short   and long term health consequence
for both the mother and the child

limitation of the gem trial include
miss clinic measure weight for
26 4   of woman at 6 month and
32 7   at 12 month postpartum   these
miss datum be due to the pragmatic
nature of the gem trial   participant
do not volunteer for a study with
12 month of longitudinal follow up on
body weight measurement   we obtain woman s weight from the ehr  
although this require woman to visit
their medical facility   still   97 4   of
woman contribute to the analysis of
measure weight across the entire
12 month postpartum period   furthermore   result base on clinic measure
postpartum weight be comparable to
those of sensitivity analysis   observe
difference in postpartum weight retention remain signiﬁcant in a sensitivity
analysis that include clinic measure
weight or self report weight   with only
13 7 and 18 6   still miss at 6 and
12 month   respectively   and a sensitivity
analysis that impute missing clinicmeasure weight   give the robustness
of our result   it be unlikely that miss
clinic measure weight datum create bias  
strength of this cluster randomize
trial include the ability to randomize all
medical facility in the kpnc region   the
large number of facility and woman   and
their racial ethnic diversity   intent totreat analysis include all facility and
woman   blinding of investigator   datum
collector   and health care provider  
and follow up extend 6 month beyond the end of the intervention   a
unique strength be that the primary
analysis be base on clinic measure
weight obtain via ehr   regardless of
woman s participation in the survey or
intervention   these feature provide generalizable   real world ﬁnding  
gem feature several aspect of pragmatic trial   which prioritize generalizability at the potential expense of
effect size give implicit sample heterogeneity and low intervention adherence   33    in contrast to traditional
clinical trial   gem have minimal exclusion criterion and the intervention be
deliver at the health system level as
optional routine care to an unselected
population   I e    regardless of motivation   perinatal complication   or comorbiditie    which likely contribute to the
50 3   intervention uptake   although
this uptake be high for a pragmatic trial
  34 35 dand considerably high than  
 
for example   the recently report uptake of 13   in the health system base
veterans health administration move  
lifestyle change program   the large
such program in the u s    36 duptake
likely impact the condition difference observe and show how challenging it be to engage patient in
prevention program   in gem   intervention effectiveness increase with the
number of session complete   although prespeciﬁed category for the
number of complete session be
use   woman be not randomize to
these category   and those who complete more session may have lose
more weight due to increase motivation for a healthy lifestyle   nevertheless  
these dose response analyse   37   suggest that to increase the effectiveness of
lifestyle intervention   strategy be
need to increase and sustain patient
engagement   if health system be to
adopt postpartum intervention for
woman with gdm   clinician referral
and other strategy to increase patient
engagement might increase uptake and
effectiveness   38    finally   the cost per
woman of the gem intervention be relatively modest   and the print telephone
modality be easily translatable to other
setting  
in conclusion   this cluster randomize
trial of diabetes prevention strategy
deliver at the health system level to
woman with gdm demonstrate that a
dpp derive   print telephone base lifestyle intervention be superior to usual
care in reduce postpartum weight retention   a risk factor for diabetes   and increase physical activity   although
condition difference be modest   difference of similar magnitude have
be show to reduce long term diabete incidence in at risk adult   30   
these ﬁnding   from a trial embed
in real world practice   may encourage
health system to adopt dpp derive
postpartum intervention to help woman
with gdm manage their weight and
increase physical activity   thereby potentially prevent or delay the onset of diabetes

among woman with a history of gdm
  28   and great sport participation be
associate with reduced postpartum
weight retention   27   
condition difference in weight observe in gem be similar to that observe in other cluster randomize
trial   in the tianjin gestational diabetes
prevention program cluster randomize
trial   29    woman in a lifestyle intervention weigh   1 kg less than woman in
the control condition at 12 month postpartum   the gem condition difference
be also similar to that observe at 12
month in the da qe cluster randomize trial   3   of adult with prediabete  
in which lifestyle intervention lead to 40
and 60   reduction in diabetes risk at
6 year   3   and 20 year   30    respectively  
suggest potential long term beneﬁcial
effect of modest weight loss   in gem  
condition difference in the proportion
meet postpartum weight goal be
statistically signiﬁcant   on average   over
the entire 12 month postpartum period  
and at 6 week and 6 month postpartum  
although condition difference at the 12month postpartum time point be not
statistically signiﬁcant   they be similar
in magnitude to those at 6 month postpartum   when the intervention end  
it be noteworthy that intervention effect
on postpartum weight retention among
woman with gdm be great in trial randomize at the individual level   31 32   than
cluster randomize trial   29    since only a
select group of motivated volunteer participate in the former   although in cluster
randomize trial such as gem only a portion of eligible woman participate   it should
be note that the effect size report be
for all woman in the facility assign to
the intervention   instrumental variable
analysis suggest that the intervention effect would be at least twofold great if all
woman have complete one or more session   suggest a potential for great impact if we can improve patient engagement
in such lifestyle intervention   to illustrate  
in the pilot study that precede gem   with
randomization at the individual level   more
woman in the intervention meet the postpartum weight goal   with a 16   absolute

estimate the proportion of case of diabetes in woman that would have be precede by a
pregnancy complicate by gdm  
 
the opportunity and incentive to undertake lifestyle measure to reduce their risk
for diabetes and encourage regular

whereas it be clear that woman who
have have gdm be at high risk of subsequent diabetes   how significant be this
group in population health term   for intervention direct at woman with gdm
to have a meaningful population health
impact   woman with gdm would need to
comprise a significant proportion of the
people ultimately destine to develop diabete   the aim of the current study be to
review early study examine the prevalence of gdm and risk of subsequent diabetes and   from these report   estimate
the potential population health impact of
gdm   to do so   we have use an epidemiological tool the population attributable risk   par

use it to estimate the proportion of case
of diabetes in the female population that
might be relate to the early development of gdm give reasonable assumption about the prevalence of gdm and
the risk of develop diabete   even in
the absence of any obvious etiological role

be associate with previous gdm   because the par be a function of the prevalence of gdm   the population effect of
gdm very much depend on its prevalence   and this in turn depend in part on
the population and diagnostic criterion
use   therefore   in australia   where the
less stringent australasian diabete in
pregnancy   adip   and mercy criterion
be use   the prevalence of gdm be
 
relatively high   5 2   8 8    and the population impact of gdm considerable   with

conclusion    this study demonstrate that a significant proportion of
the female population with diabetes
might have be detect early through
the diagnosis of gdm   although the potential range be wide   it would be reasonable to surmise that up to one third of
parous woman with diabete would have
go through a gdm pregnancy  
in estimate the par of gdm for
diabete   we have combine study
with differ duration of follow up  
 
table 3 study of gdm prevalence and calculate par publish from 1992 to 2002
 
population health significance of gdm
 
2008
 
increase over time   even without the
spurious effect of criterion change   15   
we have attempt to limit this effect by
restrict the review of gdm prevalence
to study conduct within the last 10
year   nonetheless   there be a wide
range of gdm prevalence   even between
study use the same diagnostic criterion
in similar population   which in turn have
produce a wide range of par in the
study review  
this study have analyze the proportion of case of diabete associate with
prior gdm among woman with diabetes
who have have a pregnancy   the actual
contribution of gdm for the development
of diabetes in woman be in fact low because not all woman will go through a
pregnancy   however   this be unlikely to
dramatically alter the finding of this
study because the vast majority of woman
will experience pregnancy   datum from the
1995 u s   national survey of family
growth   35   indicate that 88   of woman
aged 40    44 year will have have a pregnancy   and 82 5   will have at least one
child   in the 1996 australian census   36   
only 11   of woman age 45 year be
childless   another issue be that some
woman diagnose with gdm would have
have unrecognize preexisting diabete  
this have not be factor into our calculation   but in the majority of population
in which the study in table 2 be conduct   woman with preexist diabete
would only comprise a small percentage
of the case of gdm   so again the effect on
the result would be minimal  
the above issue not withstand  
our study suggest that a significant proportion of woman with diabete may have
be identify early via the diagnosis of
gdm   therefore   effective preventative
strategy direct at woman who have
have gdm may have the potential to produce a significant population health impact   the effect be likely to be great in
region such as australasia   where study
have consistently demonstrate a high incidence of gdm and about one third of
woman with diabetes might have be
identify early via a gdm pregnancy  
there be also other factor that reinforce the applicability of population
health prevention strategy direct at
woman with gdm   the adoption of universal screening in many country   and
even selective screening   would identify
to health care provider the vast majority
of woman at risk   this would enable
 
health provider to provide affected
woman with education regard diabetes risk and lifestyle advice   undergo a
gdm pregnancy also let the woman experience life as a diabetic individual   and
this warning may facilitate a long term
positive change in lifestyle   the systematic identification of woman by the health
system may also provide opportunity to
deliver structured public health intervention program  
the result of both the diabetes prevention program   2   and the finnish diabetes prevention study   37    where
intensive lifestyle intervention reduce
diabete rate in subject with impaired
glucose tolerance by 58   over 3   4 year  
indicate that diabetes can be prevent or
delay in high risk individual   these
result give optimism that similar effect
might be achievable in the gdm population   and indeed    15   of subject in the
diabete prevention program and the
finnish study have a history of gdm   in
economic term   this would have profound benefit   with a study in 1993 estimate that a reduction of type 2 diabetes
among woman who have have gdm in the
u s   by 50   over 10 year would save the
country   331 million   38   
in conclusion   in some population  
woman with gdm may account for a large
proportion of woman with diabete in the
future   therefore   effective preventative
strategy direct at this group may have
the capacity to exert a significant population health impact  
 
abstract
background    glucose intolerance during pregnancy predispose the offspring for increase risk of
develop glucose intolerance in the future   this vicious cycle be likely to influence and perpetuate the
incidence and prevalence of glucose intolerance in any population  
aim    no data be available about the prevalence of glucose intolerance during pregnancy in our country
and hence a study be undertake on this aspect  
method    this study be perform in the antenatal clinic of government maternity hospital   chennai  
india   as a pregnant woman in second or third trimester check into the antenatal clinic   she be give
50 gm oral glucose load and blood sample be collect after one hour   this test be perform on
1251 pregnant woman   they be request to come after 72 hour for the 75 gm ogtt recommend
by who   among the 1251 woman   891 respond   the blood sample be take in the fast state
and at 2 hour after 75 gm of oral glucose   diagnosis be base on the who criteria for gestational
diabete mellitus   gdm   
result    the mean age of these pregnant woman be 23    4 year   there be a significant increase in
the prevalence of gdm in relation to gravida   the effect of bmi do not quite reach statistical significance
  χ2   df 1     3 659   p    0 055    but a model of linear trend be significant

take only 2 hr plasma glucose for analysis   144   16 2    have a value    140 mg dl  
a similar study be conduct in different part of the country take only the 2 hr 75 gm post glucose
value of    140 mg dl as diagnostic criterion for gdm   of the total number of pregnant woman   n    3674

he prevalence of diabetes be increase globally and india
be no exception   the 1997 who estimate of the
prevalence of diabetes in adult show an expect total
rise of    120   from 135 million in 1995 to 300 million in 2025  
these number also include gdm and should alert physician

to the need to direct special attention to this population  
especially in develop country 1 the primary prevention
be likely to reverse or halt this trend   for this the need be to
focus at the intrauterine environment as the   preventive
medicine start before birth    intrauterine exposure to
hyperglycemia during the critical period of fetal development
program the development of pancrea negatively and
affect the insulin secretory function 2 hence this study be
undertake to detect the glucose intolerance that occur
during pregnancy as this metabolic disturbance predispose
the offspring for high risk of develop glucose
intolerance in their later life 3 as of today we have no current
national datum regard the occurrence of abnormal glucose
tolerance in the pregnant woman   the routine screening for

material and method
this study be carry out in raja sir ramaswamy
mudhaliar lie hospital attach to the government stanley
medical college and hospital   chennai   india during the
period february to december 2001   to obtain an unbiased
datum this maternity hospital be choose for the study as
pregnant woman from different socioeconomic strata attend
this hospital for antenatal check up and confinement  
consecutive 1251 pregnant woman in the second or third
trimester attend the antenatal clinic be give a 50 gm
oral glucose load and the venous blood be collect after
one hour 4 detail of family history of diabetes   history of
previous pregnancy and the socio economic status be
obtain   blood pressure be record   the body mass index
  bmi   of the subject be calculate and express in kg m2  
all woman be request to have their regular diet and return
after 72 hour for the 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test
recommend by who 5 the blood sample be take in the
fast state and 2 hr after 75 gm of oral glucose   the plasma
glucose be estimate by god pod method by use bayer s
kit   the result of the initial testing   50 gm 1 hr   be consider
positive if the plasma glucose    130 mg dl   this cut off value
be choose to increase the detection rate 4 a woman be
consider to have gdm if the fpg    126 mg dl and or 2 hr
plasma glucose value    140 mg dl with the 75 gm oral glucose 6

confounder and correspond χ 2   base statistic  
confidence limit be estimate by mean of the approximated
poisson distribution   p value   0 05 be consider
statistically significant   to standardise the diagnosis of gdm  
the who have propose use a 2hr 75gm ogtt   with a
threshold plasma glucose concentration of great than 7 8
mmol l   140 mg dl   at 120 minute similar to that of igt outside
pregnancy 5 moses et al adopt who criteria in their study  
where they use a single 75gm ogtt and diagnose gdm
with 2 hr ppg    140 mg dl 7 david pettit in his editorial title
  the 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test in pregnancy   favour
who recommendation 8 more importantly gdm base on
2hr 75 gm ogtt define by either who or ada criterion
predict adverse pregnancy outcome 9 hence we choose who
criterion due to the simplicity and the economical
consideration   far   assume that the effective treatment
be available   who criteria of 2 hr ppg    140 mg dl identify
a large number of case may have a great potential for
prevention 9
 
the mean age of these pregnant woman be 23    4 year  
the prevalence proportion increase with age from 15 7

discussion
we believe that the way the study subject be
ascertain provide a representative and unbiased sample
of pregnant woman   as the bulk of the pregnant woman attend
hospital of this type for antenatal check up and confinement
in our country  
among 1251 pregnant woman screen with glucose
challenge   891 respond for 2 hr 75 gm ogtt   however  
neither positive family history nor parity influence the
report for the 75 gm 2 hr test   this phenomenon of no
show rate appear to be universal   magee et al report in
their follow up   91 of the 457 positive screen individual fail
to undergo diagnostic test 10 luiz et al also observe in their
study   that 23   of their screen positive woman do not return
for ogtt 11 our prevalence rate be 18 9    we get this figure
as we take into consideration for analysis the fpg value also
as this be available besides 2hr ppg   of the 891 woman   24
have fpg    126 mg dl   they might have have pregestational
diabete   we could not confirm this as a1c estimation be not

fig   3   prevalence percentage   with 95   confidence interval   of
gestational diabete by gravida   n   891   
 
recommend as routine test for screening and hence we
also do not perform the test 12 if our estimate prevalence
proportion among those positive and negative   respectively  
for the 50 gm 1hr test be apply to total sample of 1251
woman   the revise overall prevalence proportion would be
17 7    confidence limit   15 6   19 9    against the value of
18 9   find among the 891 woman   another outcome of this
study be that the fast plasma glucose estimation be not
necessary for universal screening as this procedure identify
negligible percentage of woman with glucose intolerance
  2 69     who be also not in favour of estimation of fpg for
screen 6
an overall prevalence proportion of gdm at 17 7   in this
rather young population of pregnant woman be
considerably high   subsequent to the observation of the high
prevalence of gdm in one centre   a multicentre study be
initiate in different part of the country in 2002    2003 take
only the 2 hr 75 gm post glucose value of    140 mg dl as
diagnostic criterion for gdm   almost a similar prevalence of
15   be obtain in another govt   maternity hospital
affiliate to madras medical college in the city of chennai  
this trend of high prevalence of gdm be also find in
other part of the country   15   in trivandrum   21   in alwaye  
12   in bangalore   18 8   in erode and 17 5   in ludhiana  
the total number of pregnant woman screen in these
centre be 3674 and an overall gdm prevalence of 16 55  
be observe   this study document a definite increase
trend in the prevalence of gdm compare to that of 2   in
198213 and 7 62   in 1991 14 this trend be also see in other
country   for example in australia at one hospital where the
same testing procedure and diagnostic criterion have be
use for more than 2 decade   the prevalence have more than
double 15
a recent national survey report the prevalence of igt
in the age group of 20 29 year and 30 39 year as 12 2   and
15 3   respectively 16 no gender difference be see in the
prevalence of igt 16 far for a give population and
ethnicity the risk of diabetes and pregnancy   mirror that of
the underlying frequency of type 2 dm in the general
population   17 we also observe in our study that the
prevalence of gdm be close if not similar to the prevalence
 
www japi org
 
709
 
 
rate of igt in our population   with this huge population of
reproductive age in india   a significant segment of woman
with abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy need
cognizance  
our attempt and outcome of the screening for glucose
intolerance during pregnancy have give an insight for the
phenomenal increase in the prevalence of diabete in india  
this view be substantiate by the observation of dabelea et
al on pima indians   the gestational diabetes mellitus have a
far reach consequence in predispose the offspring to
glucose intolerance have be document in pima indians  
the child bear in 1965 to woman with gestational diabetes
be follow up till 2000   by the time they reach 35 year  
more than half of the group have diabete 3 hence as a policy
to identify gdm and its consequence on the infant a 75 gm
ogtt have be recommend to all woman in the population
during the third trimester of pregnancy 3
in india   both undernutrition and overnutrition exist during
pregnancy   there be two report study in india which be
relate to size at birth to future risk of type 2 diabetes   in
mysore   low birth weight do not increase the risk of diabetes
but baby who be short and fat   high body mass index  
bmi   at birth be at increase risk 18 fall et al speculate that
the rise in type 2 diabetes in indian urban population may
have be trigger by mild obesity in mother   lead to
glucose intolerance during pregnancy   macrosomic change
in the fetus and insulin deficiency in adult life 18 yet another
study by yajnik et al attribute high prevalence of type 2 dm
and igt in indian people may be link to poor fetal growth 19
same author also suggest that type 2 dm in india may be
program in fetal life   hence diabete prevention will have
to start in early life   in utero   and continue in later life 20 the
importance be that the intrauterine millieur interieur   whether
one of nutritional deprivation or one of nutritional plenty  
result in change in pancreatic development and peripheral
response to insulin that may lead to adult    onset gdm and
type 2 dm 21
our study favour one step procedure recommend by
who for screen instead of two step procedure use
preliminary screening with 50 gm one hr test   4 table 2 show
the result of the evaluation of the outcome of the 50 gm 1 hr
test   use the outcome of the 75 gm 2 hr test as standard  
the sensitivity of the 50 gm 1 hr test be 79 8   when
compare to the low specificity of 42 7    combine with a
relatively small number of false negative subject   this yield
reasonable high value of sensitivity   79 8    confidence limit  
72 7   85 4    and predictive value of a negative 50 gm 1 hr
test   90 1    confidence limit   86 3   92 9     however   there
be a substantial number of subject false positive for the 50
gm 1 hr test   result in poor value of specificity   42 7   
confidence limit   39 1   46 4    and predictive value of a
positive 50 gm 1 hr test   24 5    confidence limit   21 0 28 3     since the specificity of use 50 gm 1 hr test be low  
instead of perform screening test use 50 gm 1 hr test
and then 100 gm    75 gm ogtt4   a one step procedure of
perform 75gm ogtt directly be ideal as we need to perform
710
 
universal screen for glucose intolerance in pregnancy  
 
conclusion
in conclusion   our study have document the increase
prevalence of gdm in our population and we venture to give
the follow observation and recommendation   universal
screen for glucose intolerance during pregnancy be
essential as indian woman have high prevalence of diabetes
and their relative risk of develop gdm be 11 3 time
compare to white woman 22 asian woman be ethnically more
prone to develop glucose intolerance compare to other
ethnic group 15 gdm base on 2hr 75gm ogtt define by
who predict adverse pregnancy outcome and warrant
treatment 9 a 2 hr 75 gm post plasma glucose    140 mg dl
serve both as screening and diagnostic criterion besides be
a simple and economical one step procedure   as the routine
screen for glucose intolerance during pregnancy be not
do   probably the undiagnosed glucose intolerance that
have be occur in the past have result in the increase
prevalence of diabete in india   the timely action take now
in screen all pregnant woman for glucose intolerance  
achieve euglycemia in they and ensure adequate nutrition
may prevent in all probability   india become diabetes capital
of the world  
  no single period in human development provide a great
potential than pregnancy for long range pay off via relatively
short range period of enlighten metabolic manipulation   norbert frienkel

probe on attitude towards meal replacement and internet social medium tool   recur theme be identify through
qualitative content analysis of discussion transcript  
result   among the 1 201 contact and 79 eligible interest   29 woman attend a focus group discussion   more than
half of discussant be overweight obese   and less than half be physically active   for dm2 prevention   a strong need for
social support to achieve change in dietary and physical activity habit be express   in this regard   face to face
interaction with peer and professional be prefer   with adjunctive role for internet social medium   further   direct
participation of partner spouse in a dm2 prevention program be view as important to enhance support for
behavioural change at home   discussant highlight work and child relate responsibility as potential barrier to
participation   and emphasize the importance of childcare support to allow attendance   meal replacement be view
with little interest   with concern that their use would provide a poor example of eat behaviour to child  
conclusion   among woman within 5 year of a gdm diagnosis who participate in a focus group discussion   participation
in a dm2 prevention program would be enhance by face to face interaction with professional and peer   provision of
childcare support   and inclusion of spouse partner

this latter study   the lead investigator   kd   describe the
intervention   and then leave the discussion   so as not to influence
its content  
 
write educational material only    16   more in the active trial
arm attain the weight goal   although the between arm difference
be not conclusive  
there be a press need to determine the specific factor that
could improve attendance and participation in diabetes prevention
program soon after a gdm pregnancy   this be because
optimize dietary and physical activity habit have the potential
not only to prevent dm2 and cardiovascular disease in the long
term   but also to prevent recurrent gdm   particularly if additional
weight gain between pregnancy be minimize   13    therefore   we
invite woman within five year of a gdm diagnosis to a focus
group discussion with the aim of delineate factor that could
enhance participation and engagement in a dm2 prevention
program  
 
focus group discussion analysis
qualitative content analysis of the focus group transcript be
perform by the moderator and co moderator   15    the
transcript be read   re read   and text response be independently code accord to which question they address   text

some emphasize the importance of share knowledge and
experience both with health professional and with woman like
themselves  
 
preparation nutrition education program   theme 1   potential
benefit from nutrition culinary education    express a desire
to improve their knowledge of the optimal dietary intake after
gdm   as exemplify by the follow  
 
you need to get out   you need to go do stuff for yourself   I think part of
the motivation that will get you kick start be if you have people to talk
to  
 
do you follow strictly   the plan   like you be pregnant or do you deviate
from it a little because your body s handle it differently   be I go
in the right direction  
 
support at home from family member be deem as critically
important   theme 3   family participation    particularly crucial
be buy in and support from the partner spouse to alter eat
habit in the home   there be strong indication that the partner
should be directly involve in any program  
 
underpin the interest be a desire to prevent both dm2
and future gdm pregnancy   and to benefit from a behavioural
change support system   theme 2   support for lifestyle change
and maintenance   with prevention of diabetes and availability of
support system as subtheme    many be aware that gdm lead
to a high risk of diabetes in the future  
 
it s nice that we re be educate   I can tell the message to my husband  
he can be supportive   but when I give this man brown rice   he look at
I funny   so I can explain to he really what s go on but if he
would hear it from elsewhere   maybe   it ll be different  
 
it be dormant   and that s it   the old you get   the close you get to forty
   it come out   you don t realize it   but I realize that   my lifestyle have
to change

diabetes prevention and gestational diabetes
 
moreover   participant recognize and emphasize the potential for a dm2 prevention program to have positive effect on the
eat habit of all family member   particularly child  
 
I m tell you   if I walk with the group here   if there s another large
person like I   then I m go to go  
question 2   what would prevent someone like you from
take part in a program like this  
the two major barrier that emerge be lack of family
support   theme 8   and of time   theme 9    some participant
reiterate   see theme 3   that partner often do not know how to
be supportive with dm2 prevention effort   and that the ideal
program would help their partner achieve this understanding  
 
I think the kid too it s important to learn from a young age   the proper
eat habit   you might have something and it doesn t always have to
be sweet   otherwise   later on   she ll have diabete   so I think it s very
important
there be some general reflection on when the optimal timing
of a dm2 prevention program should be   theme 4   right
time opportunity for intervention    some suggest that the
good time to initiate dm2 prevention effort would be during
pregnancy   while other believe that an intervention immediately
follow pregnancy would be good to maintain the improvement
in eat habit they have achieve during pregnancy   a critical
element that emerge be the need for child care support in order
to attend dm2 prevention session   theme 5   availability of child
care   
 
I just think that our husband or mate   not that they don t want we to
be healthy and learn about this    but they also be feel time
constraint   maybe if they have an information session at the beginning
to underline how important this be   what it s go to entail   that they
might have to give up a little bit of their time for we to do that   they can
ask question   they can learn a little   and also that they know what their
spouse or their mate be do in that time that they re away
time constraint be an even more important barrier to attend
a dm2 prevention program   because of compete responsibility
relate to child and employment  
 
you could offer service where you bring a child with you in a daycare or
workshop   where you know that they be be take care of  
when probe on their view about how to integrate physical
activity into their busy schedule   participant emphasize that any
activity should be easily accessible   theme 6   awareness of
physical activity integration    have access to a trainer as part of
the program could help they get into the habit of incorporate
physical activity into their daily life  
 
time constraint be a big one   like with people with kid   I know I can t
with a drop of a dime just take off and go somewhere
question 3   what would facilitate your planning around
meal preparation  
participant express interest in develop the knowledge and
skill to increase the variety of their dietary intake   with an
emphasis on budgetary consideration   time efficiency   and
educational tool   theme 10   
 
we go through the pregnancy stage   so everyone have kid at home   I
find hardly the time do some physical activity   so maybe something
that give like   let s say every second day half an hour that I could do
even if my kid be around if it s in your house  
 
  try to use the same broccoli several time I would like to be able to
make different recipe with it in the day that follow  
   sometimes I see recipe which seem great   there be vegetable   fruit  
which cost the skin off your back and be not on special   I win t make
those recipe because they don t fit into my budget  
  quick meal   five o clock and I want to eat by six o clock   let s start  
 
potential benefit and drawback to pedometer   step count
monitor   use be address   theme 7   perceive advantage  
disadvantage on the use of pedometer and support for physical
activity as subtheme    most view the pedometer as a
potentially motivate tool to maintain or increase physical activity
level  
 
plan ahead be view as a potential mean of save time  
and participant suggest that any program should emphasize
planning strategy   several make reference to plan in order to
reduce the number of trip per week to grocery store   diabetesfriendly recipe book be think to be useful tool   other feel
that familiarize themselves with grocery store product would
enable they to make well choice   participant stress the
importance of cultural preference when plan meal   theme
11    with a need for information on nutritional content of food
specific to their culture  
 
  walk be the easy exercise you can do    because you do it   to go to
the bathroom   to clean the house    and now if you have something that
track it that tell you    ok   it s not too bad
some   however   be concern that they would be discourage if step count be low   and suggest that a pedometer
would not address their lack of motivation  
for I   it do not change anything because I be always in a car   I
walk very little so I will feel even guilty for not having walk   I will
look down at the low number and I ll feel anxious
as for food intake   support from other individual be need to
achieve and maintain high activity level  
 
  you know it s not part of the food guide but the reality be there be
people who be indian   italian   greek and you can t change your whole
family at once what be the thing that I can change without
change the culture of the food   what be the thing that you can limit
so your family doesn t feel like they can no long eat what they like  
 
I like have a buddy system   I ve never like to do exercise on my
own   I need someone there to help I to motivate I   I can t go there
alone  
 
one of the probe that we integrate query attitude about
use meal replacement product as a means of control dietary
intake   particularly as meal preparation skill be improve   the

diabetes prevention and gestational diabetes
 
aside from social medium   other proposal to facilitate social
interaction be suggest   such as the idea of a   buddy system   
and include child on social occasion  
 
idea would be to return to consumption of regular meal   tapering
meal replacement consumption  
the discussion that follow this probe suggest ambivalence
and or lack of endorsement for meal replacement use   theme 12   
a few participant view breakfast as a challenge   and an
opportunity for consume shake  
 
  it would be nice if we could partner up people who live close to each
other and sort of make a goal   we actually live pretty close together and
it would be nice to have between the two of we a cooking night together  
  if they have kid of the same age   for example   that way   we can see
each other   do something with the kid because normally   we spend most
of our free time with the kid  
 
I m hungry   I take a shake   it s a substitute I take on four out of five
morning before do my morning shift and I can say     I eat well   I
have all the nutrient I need to make it till lunch
other consider meal replacement as a healthy way to cope
with craving   compare to less healthy snack   however   more
barrier than advantage to meal replacement use be highlight   many participant be concern that meal replacement use
would constitute a poor example of eat behavior to their
child   other fear that meal replacement use could foster
poor dietary habit  
 
conclusion
among woman with prior gdm who attend a focus group
discussion   there be a clearly express need for social supportfrom family   from health professional   and from peer    to achieve
change in eat and physical activity behaviour   moreover  
while time constraint be a critical barrier to overcome   face toface interaction with peer and professional be deem
essential   social medium could provide an important   but adjunctive   role   most importantly   family relate consideration appear
to be critical in design dm2 prevention program   explicit
involvement of partner in a program would not only increase the
social support for behavioural change   but also specifically help to
achieve buy in for change in the home food environment  
attendance at face to face session require integration of childcare   as child relate responsibility would constitute an important
barrier to attendance   particularly if both partner be to attend  
our participant recognize that a dm2 prevention program
could lead not only to health benefit for themselves   but also for
their child   and this be underscore as a motivate factor  
moreover   meal replacement be view as undesirable tool  
largely because of perception that their use could distort
child s concept of healthy eating  
the importance of social support for behavioural change
highlight by our participant be consistent with prior study  
social support from family member and friend have be
demonstrate to enhance physical activity level among woman
in general   19 20    while our participant express a need for
face to face interaction   they do acknowledge that social medium
could have a role in this regard   in a previous qualitative study of
woman with a gdm history   14   great support for an internetbased approach be suggest than identify in our study  
however   in this previous study   recruitment be partly through
the internet   perhaps account for a selection of individual with
a preference for this form of intervention delivery  
our participant   assertion that alter family eat habit
require their partner   involvement and support be consistent with
a previous study indicate that household taste preference may
impede adoption of healthy dietary choice   21    in fact   dietary
intervention deliver to one spouse have be demonstrate to
have effect on the partner   I e    weight loss    even when only one
partner be involve in the intervention   22 23    far   the
offspring of woman with a gdm history be at high risk for
insulin resistance and obesity   24 26    and thus may benefit
importantly from improvement in family eating habit  
notwithstanding the substantial increase risk for dm2
follow a gdm pregnancy   few woman within five year of a
gdm diagnosis appear to be willing or able to engage in a group
discussion of potential strategy   as suggest by the 10   response
rate to our invitation   this somewhat limit the generalizability of
our finding to the wide population of woman with prior gdm  
although it likely capture the need and preference of those
 
it s not set an example if we say     I m go to have a shake and
you go and organize your own dinner  
I m against it because I have a teenager   every morning   I must argue
with she   at this moment   in her adolescence   she have an aversion to
food   she refuse to eat because she doesn t want to gain weight   all
she want to eat be those bar whereas I be try to get she to eat a
real breakfast before she go to school  
question 4   what would facilitate your interaction  
this question be preface by the moderator with the following
statement     one of the benefit of program like the one we be
study be that people have a chance to share idea with each
other   some people form friendship and even get together outside
the session   this help to support one another in make healthy
lifestyle change   now   I would like you to think about interact
with other woman in your position     the moderator specifically
probe the role of social medium option  
the discussion that address social interaction   theme 13  
reveal the perspective that   get out   and have face to face
contact with other be important to an overall sense of wellbee   social medium   such as web base group   be perceive to
be a useful tool for plan event   receive and offer
encouragement   and share knowledge  
for example   you develop something on the web and send an e mail to
the woman who participate   and we can respond to other and say  
for example     I live in   location    you live here   maybe we can find a
weekend where we go walk together or we cook together because I
think we need someone s support
for other   the use of social medium be not appeal   even as a
complementary tool to the program and have to use the
computer to interact be describe as be tedious  
  you know   I work in front of the computer all day   naturally   I don t
feel like sit in front of the computer in the evening for I the
contact   the sharing be more interesting in person than in front of the
computer  
  it would help but I think see the person because people can write
whatever they want on the web    I lose 10 lbs    you know it s see
that person   see the effect of the exercise help

diabetes prevention and gestational diabetes
 
seek assistance with dm2 prevention   among those who
explicitly indicate they could not participate   time constraint and
child relate responsibility be factor   language relate barrier may have be important for some woman   although we do
have representation from woman from several region of the
world   there be a notable absence of woman of south asian
ancestry   despite the fact that woman from this ethno cultural
group constitute an important proportion of woman see and
diagnose with gdm at antenatal clinic in montreal   27    lack
of acknowledgement of personal dm2 risk may have also affect
participation rate   a previous study indicate that although 90   of
woman with a gdm history be aware that gdm be an indicator
for future development of dm2   few than 20   view themselves
to be at risk   28    finally   some woman may acknowledge risk but
lack self efficacy to achieve change in eat habit and physical
activity level   29 30    there be likely a need to well impress upon
woman with a gdm history that they themselves be at risk for
dm2   that the risk datum be not simply impersonal statistic   and
that there be prove strategy to help they reduce this risk   with
potential health benefit for themselves and their family  
our participant voice a need for active involvement of their
partner in a dm2 prevention program   an element of face toface interaction with professional and peer be need to
maximize knowledge and support   but childcare be critical to
allow session attendance   we be presently launch a pilot study
that will include four   once month   in person hand on meal
 
preparation educational session   with on site childcare   and
partner attendance at two of the four session   support betweensession will include telephone call from study personnel and a
dedicated website with tip   tool   and opportunity for interaction among participant   we will examine effect on anthropometric measure and insulin sensitivity   a gdm diagnosis provide
a window of opportunity for dm2 prevention   if the mother and
other family member be appropriately engage   the net effect
may be reduce risk not only for the mother but also for her
partner and child

introduction
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be define as any
degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition
during pregnancy   1   2    this do not exclude glucose
intolerance that may have antedate pregnancy and
regardless of whether glucose intolerance return to normal
after delivery  
gdm be associate with increase maternal and fetal
morbidity and mortality and the degree of these adverse
outcome comparable to those of pre gestational diabete
mellitus   3   4    depend on the type of population and
the diagnostic criterion use   gdm complicate about 4   
of all pregnancy worldwide with a prevalence range of
1 14     5   6    researcher in american   european and
asian setting have report a prevalence of 1 9     7 9   
however   prevalence value as high as 11 6    have be
report from lago   nigeria   10   
gdm usually occur between 24 and 28 week of gestation as a result of increase insulin resistance in the
second trimester   1   2   6    the glucose level rise in woman
who be unable to produce enough insulin to adapt to the
increase insulin resistance   11

risk factor for the onset of gdm include previous history of unexplained intra uterine fetal death   iufd    previous current fetal macrosomia   previous history of gdm and
gross fetal malformation   11   12    increase maternal age  
family history of diabetes and overweight be also risk factor for gestational diabetes as well as pregnant woman with
current polyhydramnio and glycosuria   11   13   
pregnancy related morbidity and mortality in gdm
include fetal macrosomia   intra uterine fetal death   neonatal metabolic abnormality   hypoglycemia   polycythemia  
hyperbilirubinemia   and birth trauma   14    the perinatal
mortality rate be increase tenfold in pregnancy complicate by gdm   15    woman with gdm be also at
increase risk of operative delivery   hypertensive disorder
and development of frank diabetes later in life   16   
rarely woman with impair glucose tolerance   igt   in
pregnancy may deteriorate rapidly to overt diabetes or
occasionally   ketoacidosis may develop   11   
there be considerable variation in the screening and
diagnosis of gdm   when to screen and to whom it should
be apply   11   17    universal and risk factor base
screening have be advocate but advocate of universal
screen claim that one third to half of woman with gdm
will be miss if traditional risk factor be use for
screen gdm   11    currently gdm be diagnose use
either two   or one step method involve initial screening
procedure or direct application of the diagnostic 75 or
100 g oral glucose tolerance test   ogtt    diagnosis be
base on american diabetes association   ada   or world
health organization   who   diagnostic criterion   13   18   
gdm be associate with immediate and late fetal   neonatal and maternal complication and report suggest that
the perinatal morbidity and mortality can be reduce to
level similar to that of non diabetic woman if properly
manage   19    the prevalence of gdm and its associate
risk factor have not be document in our set   this
study be do to fill these gap in knowledge on this
important pregnancy relate condition in our clinical
set  
 
methodology
this cross sectional study be do at the antenatal clinic
of jos university teaching hospital   jos   nigeria between
february and april 2009

discussion
our study show a point prevalence of 8 3    gdm
among antenatal population of a university teaching
hospital in jos   nigeria   this prevalence be far high
than early study in nigeria which find the prevalence
of 4 5    gdm use the nddg criterion and 0 298    use
combination of criterion include fast blood sugar in
lago and port harcourt respectively   10   20    the prevalence find in our study cohort approach the 11 6   
gdm find by author who study antenatal population in
lago   south western nigeria use the same who criteria
  10    this support the assertion that the prevalence of
gdm be influence by the diagnostic method and the study
population   5   6   which in this study consist of pregnant
woman from diverse ethnic group   the lago study use
the 75 g ogtt for diagnosis of gdm which have a well
sensitivity and more likely to detect more case of gdm
compare to our study where a screening procedure   gct  
table 1 some socio demographic characteristic of the subject
also study from sri lanka   plymouth   uk and toronto  
canada report low gdm prevalence rate of 5 5   1 8
and 3 78     respectively   9   21   22    though high prevalence rate of gdm be expect compare to the finding
in this study as a result of the low threshold value of
7 2 mmol l use for a positive gct   the low prevalence
rate may be attribute to the difference in methodology
where 100 g ogtt be use for diagnosis of gdm and the
obstetric population   this low threshold value for a
positive gct detect more case of gdm as a result of its
high sensitivity of 90    in identify gdm   though the
same method be use as in this study for screen of
gdm   the prevalence rate be high than 7 2    report
from porto alegre   brazil   23    this may be attribute to the
racial and ethnic difference and a reflection of different
glycemic response in these study population  
 
123
 
the pattern of glucose tolerance in this study population
be markedly different from that report from ilorin  
nigeria with value of 14 7   64 7 and 5 88    for normal
glucose tolerance   igt and overt diabetes   respectively
  24    the methodology use in the ilorin study include the
use of a 100 g ogtt   additionally   the study population
comprise those suspect of have gdm and be
refer to the metabolic clinic for confirmation   this
methodology could be responsible for the high prevalence report in their study population when compare to
the prevalence find in our study   this pattern be also
slightly different from the one report from lago where
88 7   8 7 and 2 9    of the woman be find to have
normal glucose tolerance   igt and overt diabetes   respectively   10    though 75 g ogtt be use in both study  
the different pattern report may be a result of the direct
use of the 75 g ogtt on the subject without a prior
screen test as do in our study and difference in
glucose homeostasis between the study group may be
contributory   the mean age of 31 2 year in this study be
comparable to that report in two separate study in
nigeria   lago and port harcourt   10   20   
of the risk factor for gdm   our study find history of
previous fetal macrosomia as the only independent risk
factor for gdm   adjust or 11 1   95    ci 2 93   42 12  
p    0 0004    our study finding be compare with report of
other study elsewhere   23   25    although other risk factor
of gdm be not find to be significant in the multivariate
model   these be probably a result of the short duration
of the study and or influence by unknown confound
factor in the study population   a large study be need to
identify other risk factor for gdm in our clinical setting  
we note some limitation of our study   first   we
focus on pregnant woman attend a tertiary academic
medical centre in one institution in nigeria which could
limit the generalizability of our study finding to only the
study population in nigeria   we also conduct a one timepoint assessment for gdm and could not follow the woman
to determine birth outcome and subsequent ogtt after
delivery   we therefore can not claim causal association
between gdm and the risk factor identify in our study  
 
 
arch gynecol obstet   2013   287 859 863
 
we   however   conclude that the prevalence of gdm in
our cohort attend a tertiary academic medical centre in
nigeria be relatively high   8 3     and woman with previous
history of fetal macrosomia should be screen routinely
for gdm   this may help to detect woman with gdm early
especially those with overt diabetes mellitus and give
opportunity for early intervention and improve obstetric
outcome

introduction
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm    the most common
metabolic disorder of pregnancy   be define as   the type of
glucose intolerance that develop in the second and third
trimester of pregnancy   result in hyperglycemia of variable severity    1    as a consequence of increase obesity

prevalence and advance maternal age   the incidence of
gdm be increase worldwide   constitute a major economic burden for the public health care system   1   2    in
fact   gdm confer an increase risk for severe pregnancy
complication for both mother and child   include cesarean delivery   shoulder dystocia   macrosomia   and neonatal
hypoglycemia   3    in addition   woman with gdm have a
substantially increase risk to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus   t2 dm   and cardiovascular disease   cvd   after pregnancy   4   5    while their offspring be at increase risk for
the development of obesity and t2 dm early in life   6   
therefore   strategy address to optimize management of
gdm be mandatory   these should include effective prevention   and proper diagnosis and treatment  
 
epidemiology
as report before   the prevalence of gdm in a population of pregnant woman usually reflect the prevalence
of t2 dm in that population   2    as a consequence of the
unfavorable global shift toward a western lifestyle of overeating and sedentary live   a pandemic diffusion of t2 dm
be occur today throughout the entire world   1    which
contribute importantly to the dramatic increase in the incidence of gdm rate   2    nevertheless   the exact worldwide
prevalence of gdm remain unknown   as systematically
synthesize datum on this be lack   2    and the only available information be that gdm prevalence be largely variable
among country and even among region within a country  
range from 0 6 to 15    depend on the race ethnicity
and socio economic status of individual   2    aboriginal
in australia   middle eastern   syrian   lebanese   iraqi   iranian   or afghanistan   and pacific islander woman be the
major at risk group for gdm   2    recent epidemiological

study indicate that the prevalence of gdm be over 9   in
the united states of america   7    whereas native americans   asians   hispanic   and african american woman be
at high risk for gdm than non hispanic white woman
  7    in asian country   gdm range from 3 0 to 21 2    7   
while in india   gdm be more common in woman live in
urban area than in those live in rural area   7    on the
other hand   recent evidence indicate that the prevalence of
gdm may vary accord to season   with high value
during the summer season than in the winter season   8   
also   it must be consider that a further push toward
the increase prevalence of gdm be derive from the
adoption of tight diagnostic criterion for gdm   which have
be recently introduce by the international association
of the diabetes and pregnancy study group   iadpsg  
  9    these new criterion recommend a universal 75 g oral
glucose tolerance test   ogtt   screen for pregnant
woman   which employ more rigorous cut off of glucose
level   the adoption of these new criterion result in a
considerable increase in gdm prevalence   10    reach
27 5   in southern italy   11   and 41 9   in north indian

etiology
there be significant change in maternal metabolism during the course of pregnancy   13    during the first phase  
these change be mostly anabolic change with the progressive increase of maternal adipose tissue   whereas in
late pregnancy the catabolic change prevail with increase
lipolysis and an increase in glycemia   insulinemia   postprandial fatty acid level   and decrease maternal fat store  
these alteration be induce   at least in part   by hormone
and other mediator secrete by placenta   which facilitate
the occurrence of a physiological condition of peripheral
insulin resistance   13   that can be worsen by both advanced
maternal age and pre pregnancy overweight   table 1   
two condition that have become typical in western country   the effect of pregnancy on glucose homeostasis be
generally alleviate follow delivery of the placenta   so
that glycemia return to normal level within 6 12 week
postpartum   the negative influence of pre pregnancy overweight or obesity on gdm be underline by the observation
that physical activity   both before pregnancy and in early
pregnancy   by ameliorate body weight loss and insulin
resistance   be inversely associate with the risk of gdm
  14    when insulin secretion do not increase adequately
to counterbalance the insulin resistant state of the second
half of pregnancy   maternal glucose intolerance appear
and may contribute to the increase risk for develop
gdm   fig   1    13    thus   β cell secretory impairment represent a critical defect in the pathophysiology of gdm

the defect in β cell function be not specific to pregnancy
as it may exist before and after pregnancy   and in most
case be progressive   confer a high risk of overt diabete after the index pregnancy   15    thus   as already point
out   gdm could be see as an early stage of t2 dm which
appear during pregnancy   15   
to date   many evidence exist point to a link between
genetic and gdm   fig   1    among these   the fact that
gdm recur in at least 30   of woman with a previous history of gdm   16    the grow body of epidemiological
research show some ethnic group difference in the risk
for gdm   independently of the living place   7    and the
identification of numerous genetic variant in many gene
that be involve in insulin secretion and insulin resistance  
as well as in lipid and glucose metabolism   which have
be associate with gdm risk   17    in particular   about
this latter point   many of the variant identify be associate with increase risk for t2 dm   18    thereby support the notion for a continuum between gdm and t2 dm  
table 2 show example of gene variant whose association
with susceptibility to gdm have be report in several
meta analysis study   in which most of the gene involve
be find to be relate to the regulation of insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance   because of these
pathophysiological similarity between gdm and t2 dm  
metabolomic study of gdm have be recently design
to identify biomarker of disease   25    although further
study be necessary in large   ethnically different population   25   26    many metabolite that be know to be
implicate in impair glucose homeostasis or be specific
for inflammation and altered redox balance have be associate with gdm   27 29   
on the other hand   study have be report
emphasize the relevance of epigenetic modification of placental dna in gdm   independently of other
well know risk factor   fig   1    30    furthermore  
increase evidence indicate that dysregulation of
immune and inflammatory activation may play a role

be report in woman with gdm   fig   1    31    there
be also the increase use of endocrine disrupt chemical   which may be a risk factor for gdm   32   
 
gdm and long term health consequence
gdm not only increase the risk for maternal and fetal
complication during pregnancy   but it also raise the risk
of long term complication in both mother and offspring  
 
902
 
once gdm be diagnose   the risk for both t2 dm and cvd
in the mother increase   in particular   the risk of t2 dm
increase by sevenfold   with a cumulative incidence of 60  
at 10 year from gdm diagnosis   4    the rate of t2 dm
increase rapidly during the first month after delivery  
continue to increase thereafter without sign of a plateau
  33    also   woman with prior gdm have a significantly
high rate of obesity   hypertension and metabolic syndrome   together with altered level of circulate inflammatory marker   all of which be risk factor for cvd   34   35   
while several protocol have be propose in the postpartum follow up phase to counteract and prevent t2 dm   36   
further study be need to identify and validate biomarker for cvd   and to determine whether lifestyle and drug
intervention can reduce the risk for cvd in these woman
  35   
as say above   long term complication relate to
gdm may also affect the offspring of gdm mother   in
this regard   child of gdm woman be more often overweight or obese   37   38    show great central adiposity
  38 40    high blood pressure   40   41    insulin resistance
and impair glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia   41   
thereby indicate that the offspring of gdm pregnancy
be at increase risk of develop t2 dm and cvd later
in life   40   41    thus emphasize the importance of a more
rigorous management and prevention of gdm  
 
diagnosis
prompt identification of pregnant woman with gdm be a
critical need   as an early appropriate treatment can reduce
both mild and severe pregnancy relate complication  
neverthless   there be no universal uniformity on issue
concern screen time   diagnostic test and the appropriate glycemic cut off that should be use to define
gdm   until 2010   the most widely employ criterion for
gdm include those of the world health organization
  who   and the american diabetes association   ada   
in particular   to predict gdm   a 100 g ogtt be recommend by ada in early pregnancy   14 18 week
of gestation   for high risk woman and in late pregnancy
  28 32 week   for woman at medium risk   follow the
carpenter and coustan cut off   42    these ada criterion be later revise follow the demonstration   by
the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome
  hapo   study   that increase level of maternal glycemia be linearly associate with maternal and fetal
adverse event   3    so that new   more rigorous criterion  
have be elaborate by the international association
diabete pregnancy study group   iadpsg    9    which
recommend fast plasma glucose   fpg    glycosylate
hemoglobin   hba1c    or random plasma glucose in all
 
13
 
j endocrinol invest   2017   40 899 909
 
woman at the first prenatal visit   the revise guideline
state that a diagnosis of gdm be make when the result  
not diagnostic of overt diabete   indicate a fpg   92 mg  
dl   on the contrary   if fpg be   92 mg dl   a 2 h 75 g
ogtt should be perform at 24 28 week   gestation
  table 3    gestational glycemic cut off value during
ogtt be low compare to previous guideline   42   
and only one abnormal value of glycemia during ogtt
be sufficient to make diagnosis of gdm   table 3   4   
give this   it be not surprising that iadpsg criterion drastically increase the number of gdm case   compare to
previously adopt criterion   10   
these recommendation have be adopt by the ada
as well as the who   1   43   and the american association of clinical endocrinologist   aace    44    table 3   
instead   the canadian diabetes association   cda   recommend that all woman be screen with a 1 h glucose measurement after a 50 g oral glucose load between 24 and 28
week s gestation   follow by the 2 h 75 g ogtt only if
the threshold have be surpass   table 3    45    this twostep approach   commonly use in usa   be support by
the american college of obstetrician and gynecologist
  acog    46    and recommend by the nih consensus
development conference   table 3    47    on the other hand  
selective screening base on individual risk assessment have
be propose by several international medical society
  table 3    47 50    therefore   up to date   a variety of different criterion be routinely use worldwide to diagnose gdm  
with disparity among and within country   mainly due to
the need to reconcile well health care quality for pregnant
woman and their newborn with public finance   in this
respect   adoption of the iadpsg s recommendation have
lead to an increase in the diagnosis of gdm   10    which have
profoundly impact on the health care system   it have be
calculate that the overall cost of care for a woman with
gdm be   35   great than for a woman without gdm
  51    overall   the one step approach should be prefer
because of its simplicity in execution with more patient
adherence   its accuracy in diagnosis of gdm   and also its
closeness to international consensus   52    alternatively   to
contain the cost   selective screening could be perform
only in woman at risk for gdm   I e   woman who be overweight or obese   woman of advanced maternal age   woman
with previous gdm or macrosomic infant   woman of highrisk ethnic group or those with a family history of diabetes
among first degree relative    although study have be
able to show that selective screening would miss a significant proportion of case of gdm with minimal cost saving
  11   53   54    the international diabetes federation   idf  
give some attention to this aspect by suggest that selective screening should be consider only in particular epidemiological and clinical condition   and local cost effectiveness   55

additionally   doubt have emerge concern the threeshold value indicate by the iadpsg to define internationally accept criterion for the diagnosis of gdm   56  
57    in fact   the hapo study   on which the iadpsg criterion be largely base   examine mainly caucasian woman  
and finding may not apply to all population   as a consequence of this   the indian health care system continue
to adopt the diabetes in pregnancy study group india
  dipsi   guideline that recommend universal screen twice during pregnancy by follow the one step 2 h
75 g ogtt   irrespective of the last meal timing   table 3  
  58    however   challenge datum have be report on the
cost effectiveness of this approach compare to iadpsg
  59    in addition   although several study confirm that
iadpsg criterion allow to identify more at risk woman   the
major efficacy of these criterion in identify pregnancy at
risk for severe adverse outcome be still controversial   compare to other guideline   60   61    while 25   of pregnant
woman could be reclassify in view of the poor reproducibility of ogtt   47   
hence   although the iadpsg criterion be the only outcome base criterion   some author suggest a combine
strategy that would consider the ethnic and regional characteristic of woman with gdm   and the different resource
available   56   57   61    in this context   by adopt the
ogtt threeshold recommend by iadpsg   we recently
propose the new capula s index that increase the accuracy of selective screening by reduce both the number of
potential false negative and the number of woman to be
screen   62    thereby reduce the impact of gdm on
pregnancy and on health care cost   base on universal
predictor of gdm and pregnancy complication   capula s
index allow a well correlation with the risk for maternal
and neonatal adverse event   62   
 
treatment
pregnant woman with untreated gdm have a great risk
of develop many adverse maternal   fetal and neonatal
outcome   63    also   a strong association between maternal glucose concentration and perinatal complication have
 
13
 
be report in the hapo study   in woman with milder
form of gdm   at glucose level below those usually consider diagnostic of gdm   thus   early and efficacious
treatment of these woman be decisive to reduce perinatal
and obstetrical complication   64   65   
most gdm woman can be effectively manage with a
programme of lifestyle intervention comprise dietary
counseling and enhance physical activity   together with
self monitoring of blood glucose   63    that be essential for
verify the effectiveness of treatment and reduce risk of
complication   although no randomise trial have be conduct to define the optimal treatment target   a substantial uniformity exist on the importance of self monitoring
blood glucose   table 3    current general guideline   in this
regard   recommend to assess postprandial glucose level at
1   and 2 h   table 3    give that several study have demonstrate that treatment decision base on these parameter
result in few complication   66    thus suggest that
postprandial glucose excursion be of major importance in
pregnant woman with less elevated hba1c level   67   
appropriate nutrition therapy in gdm woman become
effective to meet the maternal and fetal nutritional need  
and to achieve and maintain glycemic control   which be
essential to improve pregnancy outcome   thereby result in cost saving for more intensive medical care   include insulin treatment and other medication   this aspect be
of particular relevance in the light of the recent increase in
the prevalence of gdm   general guideline   in this respect  
emphasize the choice of nutrient that will promote proper
weight gain and euglycemia without ketonuria   and moderate calorie restriction for obese pregnant   63    base on
the observation that elevate postprandial glucose concentration be often associate with adverse pregnancy outcome in gdm   66    diet therapy for gdm have be historically base on carbohydrate restriction in order to blunt
postprandial hyperglycemia   63    nevertheless   as underline elsewhere   68   69    a minimum of 175 g carbohydrate day should be provide to avoid nutritional deficiency and ketosis   which can lead to negative consequence
for the neonate   however   although large control randomize prospective study be need to define the well
nutritional intervention in gdm   recent evidence in this
 
 
j endocrinol invest   2017   40 899 909
 
direction indicate that diet contain great amount of
complex carbohydrate and fiber and low amount in glycemic index carbohydrate and saturated fat can be effective in blunt postprandial glucose excursion and in
improve maternal insulin resistance and fetal fat accumulation   70   
similarly to what occur in the case of t2 dm   with
which gdm share the same pathogenetic mechanism  
sedentary lifestyle be a risk factor for gdm   whereas regular physical activity can help reduce this risk   71    the beneficial effect of exercise be mainly explain by the increase
in insulin sensitivity that commonly occur from exercise
and its beneficial impact on body weight   although specific
guideline on exercise prescription   the type   frequency and
intensity of exercise   be lack   some practical recommendation be make concern physical activity in gdm
woman as an initial step in combination with diet   63    in
particular   a minimum of 30 min of moderate exercise per
day be recommend for normal pregnancy   take into
account that preferable activity be those that avoid excessive and inappropriate abdominal muscle contraction   63   
if these measure do not ensure optimal glycemic control  
subcutaneous insulin injection therapy must be consider   as insulin do not cross the placental barrier   it be
consider harmless to the foetus   nevertheless   as already
report   72    insulin therapy have many disadvantage  
include the initial fear and anxiety and the need for education and skill in injection and dose adjustment   as well
as the risk of hypoglycemia and more weight gain  
in the last year   many study have investigate the
safety and effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drug in the
treatment of gdm   recently   result of a large randomized
control trial demonstrate no significant increase in perinatal complication among woman with gdm who be
randomly treat with metformin   as compare with gdm
woman who be treat with insulin   73    accordingly  
both cda and the national institute for health and clinical
excellence   nice   recommend metformin as an option for
the treatment of gdm   45   74    although   caution should
be use give the ability of metformin to cross the placenta
and the lack of long term follow up datum from both mother
and child   also   metformin have not yet be approve for
gdm treatment in all country  
glyburide   glibenclamide   be a sulfonylurea largely
investigate in pregnant woman with gdm   safety and
effectiveness of glyburide in gdm be recognize and
confirm   75   76    accord to more recent study   however   glyburide be inferior to either insulin or metformin and
therefore should not be employ for treat woman with
gdm if insulin or metformin be available   77   
the importance of vitamin d in gdm have be raise in
recent study show a relation between hypovitaminosis
d and alter glucose homeostasis during pregnancy   78   
 
905
 
however   if from one side there be evidence that the administration of vitamin d can ameliorate insulin resistance and
glucose tolerance by act on pancreatic β cell and attenuate insulin resistance associate systemic inflammation   79    on the other hand far randomize study be
necessary to see whether vitamin d supplementation effectively improve glycemic control in woman with gdm  
 
prevention
base on the above information underline the adverse
impact of gdm on pregnancy and on health care system  
approach aim at prevent or minimize gdm be
mandatory   as overweight and obesity be strong predictor of gdm   80    while diet and exercise be effective in
prevent and control the disease   most of the study
undertake so far on this issue have investigate the role of
these intervention in the prevention of gdm   81    however   no significant effect of diet or combine diet and exercise be find in trial enrol woman with no defined
risk factor for gdm   81    in overweight and obese pregnant woman   only one trial indicate a reduction of gdm
risk   82    while another trial reveal the reduction of
macrosomia incidence in the absence of effect on gdm
risk and gestational weight gain   83    in a recent european
multicentre   randomise control trial   enrol consecutive pregnant woman with a bmi   29 kg m2   it be demonstrate that a healthy eating intervention combine with
physical exercise result in less gestational weight gain
with no impact   however   on reduce fast plasma glucose   84    in contrast with these finding   the effectiveness
of physical activity before and in early pregnancy for the
prevention of gdm have be prove in a recent meta analysis   14    and support by a recent randomize control
trial in a chinese population   85    certainly   the heterogeneity of the study examine can account for much of this
disparity   so that no definitive conclusion can be make and
more trial with large population and long follow up
period be need   81   
metformin decrease the incidence of t2 dm in adult
with impaired glucose homeostasis   86    as well as it
reduce the incidence of t2 dm in woman with previous gdm   87    however   no specific effect of metformin
on the incidence of gdm have be observe so far   88   
except for woman with polycystic ovary syndrome   pcos   
a condition of insulin resistance among woman of reproductive age   in a prospective cohort study of woman with
pcos   metformin use before conception be associate
with a reduce risk of develop gdm and pre eclampsia
  89    neverthless   this be not confirm in another trial   in
which metformin be initiate during pregnancy and not in
the preconception period   90   
906
 
instead   promise result in this direction have come
from use of nutritional supplement and probiotic product   81    in particular   trial be carry out to analyze
the effect of myoinositol   an insulin sensitizer belong to the vitamin b complex group   in woman with a
single define risk factor for gdm   91    result from
these study be encourage as a significant reduction
be observe in the incidence of gdm   macrosomia  
and neonatal hypoglycaemia   even here   caution have to
be use as all clinical trial have a limited sample size
and be perform solely in italy   thus   trial in other
population with large sample size be necessary to confirm and extend these result   92    similar consideration
can also be apply to the use of probiotic supplement  
which be a combination of micro organism design to
modify maternal gut microbiota   there be some evidence
that probiotic may ameliorate insulin resistance in the
pre   and post partum period   and decrease the woman s
risk of develop gdm especially when combine with
a diet intervention program   93   
an emerge issue in this area relate to bariatric surgery and its effectiveness in the management of obesity and
associate metabolic condition   94    several study have
be report concern the effect of weight loss surgery
in prevent gdm and its related negative outcome in
obese woman   95    result from these study support the
association of bariatric surgery with reduce risk of weight
gain during pregnancy   gdm   and gestational hypertension   95   96    even though this positive impact be counterbalance by the occurrence of surgical complication and
nutritional and vitamin deficiency during and after pregnancy   95    also   controversial datum exist about the risk
and benefit of bariatric surgery in the obstetric population
  95   96    so that far and large prospective study be
necessary before bariatric surgery s efficacy in gdm and
gdm related complication can be establish  
 
conclusion
similarly to obesity and t2 dm   the management of woman
with gdm be a major emerge challenge for the health
care system around the world   which be magnify by the
lack of globally share guideline for gdm   thus   further
effort be necessary to identify effective prevention strategy that would facilitate clinical management of gdm and
would likely improve health and cost effectiveness

finally   our finding of the relative lack of effectiveness interestingly   among woman without a history of gdm  
of metformin in woman who do not have a history of metformin be not effective in reduce progression to

such a history   among woman report a history of gdm   both intensive lifestyle and metformin
therapy reduce the incidence of diabete by approximately 50   compare with the placebo group  
whereas this reduction be 49 and 14    respectively in parous woman without gdm   these datum suggest
that metformin may be more effective in woman with a gdm history as compare with those without  
conclusion   progression to diabetes be more common in woman with a history of gdm compare
with those without gdm history despite equivalent degree of igt at baseline   both intensive

thus exclude woman with early postpartum conversion to

mean age of woman with a history of gdm enter dpp be
43 yr with a mean interval of 12 yr from the index gdm
pregnancy   suggest that we may have exclude many
woman with the high risk of diabetes conversion   despite
this and the fact that those report a history of gdm be
young   the dpp subgroup with a history of gdm have a
crude incidence rate of diabetes that be 71   high than that

of parous woman without a history of gdm   even many year
after the pregnancy complicate by gdm   it appear that
woman continue to be at risk for development of diabetes  
therefore   continue follow up and test for diabetes

although test of interaction between the effect of intervention and the history of gdm be not significant and the study
be not power for these test   our datum suggest a differential

among those with a history of gdm   on average   these woman
be less able to sustain the prescribed level of physical activity

in summary   in dpp   woman with a report history of
gdm have a markedly increase risk for diabetes compare
with parous woman with a similar degree of glucose intolerance and no gdm history   intervention with metformin and
il be comparable in reduce the development of diabetes
with only an estimate five to six individual require treatment to prevent one case of diabetes over 3 yr   in woman
without a history of gdm as well as in the dpp cohort overall  
il be find to be far more effective than metformin therapy   in those with history of gdm   the absence of a difference
between il and metformin may be due to the minimal weight
loss achieve with il among gdm woman   we conclude that
woman with a history of gdm who currently have igt remain at an increase risk of develop diabete year after the
index pregnancy and appear to benefit from either lifestyle or
pharmacologic intervention

background   the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be increase worldwide   gdm be associate
with increase risk for mother and child during pregnancy and in later life   the aim of this article be to
systematically review literature on the effectiveness of intervention to prevent gdm  
method   control trial find in pubmed   embase   or central be select   the primary outcome be
gdm   and relevant secondary outcome be maternal fast blood glucose and large for gestational age
  lga   or macrosomia   datum be combine in meta analysis   and the quality of evidence for the effectiveness of
the intervention be assess in a grade approach  
result   nineteen study evaluate six type of intervention be include   dietary counseling significantly
reduce gdm incidence compare to standard care   none of the intervention be effective in lower maternal fasting blood glucose   low glycemic index   lgi   diet advice and an exercise program significantly
reduce the risk of macrosomia   the quality of evidence for these outcome be low  
conclusion   the result indicate that there may be some benefit of dietary counseling   an lgi diet advice   or an
exercise program   however   well design study be require to generate high quality evidence   at the
moment   no strong conclusion can be draw with regard to the good intervention for prevention of gdm  
 
crease risk for develop t2d 7 the cause of gdm be the
inability to meet the demand for increase insulin production
to counteract the increase insulin resistance cause by hormone produce in pregnancy   because of the overlap in risk
factor for gdm and t2d and the similarity in the underlie pathophysiology   it be likely that strategy that be effective in the prevention of t2d might be successful in the
prevention of gdm 8 10 these intervention involve reduce
overweight and obesity   limit gestational weight gain  
improve diet and physical activity behavior   and various
drug therapy with glucose lower agent 8 10 it be important to identify intervention that might prevent the development of glucose intolerance in pregnancy   therefore   our
aim be to systematically review the literature on   quasi  
randomize control trial   rct   focus on intervention to prevent gdm   the primary outcome of interest be
the incidence of gdm   and secondary outcome be blood
glucose level and macrosomia

pregnancy 3 4 usually between 24 and 28 week   in 2010   the
need to diagnose woman with likely prepregnancy diabete
be recognize   and test for overt diabete at the first visit
for prenatal care be recommend 5 approximately 1

method of study selection
search strategy
the database pubme   embase   and central   cochrane central register of control trial   be search
from january 1980 until march 2011 for relevant study   the
search strategy focus on four element    1   a population

filter from robinson and dickersin11    these term be use
as mesh term and as free text word   adjust to each database   the search be limit to publication in the following
language   english   german   danish   dutch   finnish   norwegian   and swedish   after inclusion of the article that meet the
selection criterion   we search the reference list of the include
study and of relevant review article for other eligible study  
selection of study
two reviewer   n o   and m v p    evaluate the study
identify with the search strategy   they independently review the title and the abstract of every study to determine
if the study meet the inclusion criterion   when need   the full
text of the article be also retrieve   the article be blind
for author   institution   and journal   any difference in opinion
with regard to the inclusion or exclusion of a study be resolve by consensus  
inclusion criterion be   1   study sample consist of
pregnant woman    2    quasi   rct    3   the study evaluate an
intervention that could prevent gdm   and   4   the outcome
measure include gdm incidence and maternal fasting
blood glucose level   exclusion criterion be woman with
gdm or preexist diabetes mellitus type i or type ii   to
evaluate the incidence of gdm   a large sample size be require   most rct have not enough power to evaluate gdm  
therefore   we also choose to look at effect on a secondary
outcome measure   maternal fasting blood glucose   as a surrogate outcome for gdm   in addition   macrosomia   macrosomial   birth weight above 4000 gram   or lga   above goth
percentile   pgo   for gotationalage   be choose as a secondary
outcome in this review because it be the most important infant
outcome associate with gdm  
methodologic quality and quality of evidence
the two reviewer independently determine the methodologic quality of the select study   the quality be score

author of the original publication be contact for additional information   the grading of recommendation assessment   development and evaluation   grade   approach
be use to determine the overall quality of evidence for each
type of intervention 13 the quality of the evidence be assess for five domain   limitation of the study   consistency of
 
oostdam et al  
the result   directness   generalizability    precision   and publication bias 13 the overall quality of evidence be consider to
be high if multiple rct with a low risk of bias provide
consistent and generalizable finding   direct and precise datum  
and no know or suspect publication bias 13 from this
start point   the quality of evidence be downgrade one

datum analysis
meta analysis be perform among study with the
same kind of intervention that report on the same outcome  
for the dichotomous measure gdm and macrosomia   we
calculate relative risk   rr   or risk difference   rd   with 95  
confidence interval   cis    for the continuous measure   maternal fasting glucose   we calculate weight mean difference   wmd   with 95   cis when it be measure in the same
way in trial   fix effect meta analysis be apply to combine datum in the absence of significant heterogeneity between
trial   statistical heterogeneity be assess with the cochran s q test and by calculate i2 value   i2 value of 25   
50    and 75   can be interpret as low   substantial   and
considerable heterogeneity   the random effect model for
meta analysis be use when i2 value exceed 50   
methodologic explanation for substantial heterogeneity

apart from the sensitivity analysis   we look at methodologic explanation for heterogeneity   difference in intervention or population or both   when substantial statistical
heterogeneity be find   substantial heterogeneity be
find for metformin on gdm   for dietary counseling on
macrosomia   and for exercise on gdm   for the three study
on metformin   no methodologic explanation for heterogeneity
could be find   as the intervention and the study population
be very similar   the nine study on dietary counseling
show much methodologic heterogeneity   such as the start
of the counseling   first or second trimester   and the frequency
of the counseling   vary from twice only to weekly during
pregnancy    most importantly   these study differ because
in addition to the variation in dietary counseling   most of the
intervention also have a co intervention   such as home glucose monitoring   exercise   weight gain monitoring   or probiotic   these intervention may have reinforce the effect of
the dietary intervention   however   exclude one study at a
time do not change the result of find no effect of dietary

conclusion
in this systematic review   we identify 19   quasi   rct
that evaluate the effect of an intervention for the prevention
of gdm   six type of intervention be include in this review  
metformin therapy   lgi diet   dietary counseling   probiotic  
self monitoring of weight gain   and exercise   gdm incidence
be significantly low among woman who receive dietary
counseling compare with woman who receive usual care  
one study that focus on probiotic report also a significant
reduction in the incidence of gdm   furthermore   we identify
a significantly reduce risk for a macrosomic infant among
woman who receive advice on an lgi diet during pregnancy

provide by the author of the article  
compare with woman who receive advice on an hgi diet
and also among woman who receive an exercise training
program   none of the six intervention cause a significant
difference in maternal fasting glucose  
base on the grade approach   we find that the evidence
for most of the finding describe be of   very   low quality   the
main reason for the low quality of evidence be limitation
in study design   lack of blind    small sample size   and
imprecision of the result   because of the nature of the intervention   in the majority of the study   advice on diet or exercise    blinding of patient be almost impossible   although
great effort could be put into blind aspect in future
study   the blinding of outcome assessor and care provider   in particular   should be feasible in most circumstance  
the result of the current review have to be interpret with
caution because of the limited number of study per intervention and per outcome and the heterogeneity in population   intervention   and diagnostic procedure of gdm   this
be underline in the sensitivity analysis   where exclude
outlier or large trial in some instance change the result  
effect of intervention
metformin be an insulin sensitize drug that be use to
correct metabolic and endocrine abnormalities15 and can only
be use in high risk population   pcos or gdm    three
studies15 24 28 assess the effect of continue the use of
 
metformin in pregnancy for the prevention of gdm in woman
with pcos   we find no evidence of a significant difference
in maternal fasting glucose or the risk for gdm or macrosomia among woman who receive metformin therapy   the
intervention and the study population be very similar in
these study   in the begum et al   study 15 woman in the
control group receive nothing   whereas woman in the vanky
et al   studies24 28 control group receive folate and multivitamin tablet in addition to placebo capsule   whatever the
cause of the discrepancy between the begum and the vanky
study   it be clear that more research be need to evaluate the
possible effect of metformin in the prevention of gdm  
three study compare lgi and hgi dietary advice 17 30 32
the result suggest that woman who receive advice on an
lgi diet have significantly low risk of have an lga infant  
an hgi diet be think to be comparable to the normal diet of
many people live in western industrialized society 17
nevertheless   to study the effect of an lgi diet   it might be
well to compare it with no dietary advice or standard dietary
advice during pregnancy   although this might decrease the
contrast between the study group somewhat   it would result
in a more realistic estimate of the effect that can be obtain
with an lgi diet  
there be no trial that compare an lgi diet with usual
care   however   only other dietary counseling intervention
be compare to usual care   and in the nine studies16 18 19 21 22 25 26 27 31 in which this comparison be make   it
 
 
12
be find that dietary counseling have a significant effect on
the incidence of gdm   these nine intervention have in common that they advise a reduction in energy intake or reduce weight gain but be considerably heterogeneous in
other aspect   as mention in the sensitivity analysis section  
most importantly   the nine study differ in the co intervention   such as home glucose monitoring   exercise   weight
gain monitoring   and probiotic   these co intervention may
have reinforce the effect of the dietary intervention   in another review of dietary intervention for the prevention of
gdm   carry out in 2008 38 tieu et al   conclude that an lgi
diet lower maternal fast glucose level and result in
few lga infant   however   this review do not include the
study by rhode et al   30 who find no significant difference
in maternal fasting glucose and lga infant  
review focus on the prevention of t2d have recommend lgi diet and healthy mediterranean style diets39 or intervention aim at increase exercise   combine
with diet 40 a cochrane review conclude that the available
datum suggest that there be benefit in follow an energycontrolled diet   with an increase in consumption of fresh fruit
and vegetable and a decrease in the intake of simple sugar  
although more evidence be need 41 probiotic be find to
be effective in the reduction of gdm in one high quality trial
focus on this intervention   more research be need to
confirm this finding  
strength and limitation
a strength of this systematic review be that all relevant
publication on intervention for the prevention of gdm be
systematically identify and evaluate   the search be very
extensive to ensure that we include all type of intervention  
and by independently score all the article   we maintain
objectivity   a possible limitation of this review be that it be
restrict to   quasi   rct in addition to a language restriction  
as in any other review   publication bias might have affect
the result   the study use different method for screen
and diagnosis of gdm   for instance   they use different cutoff
point for glucose level in the diagnosis of gdm   this   in
combination with study population that vary in risk for
gdm   will have influence the result with regard to the incidence of gdm report in the article   however   difference
in gdm incidence find between research group within one
study can be attribute to the intervention under study   another drawback be relate to the fact that our analysis be
base on the datum report in the publication   some of which
do not give a detailed description of the relevant datum on
outcome measurement   one way in which we try to solve
this problem be to ask all author individually to provide
miss information   although most of they do   not all author respond to our request   so not all of the identify
study could be include in the meta analysis  
implication for future research
give the limited number of study and the small sample
size in most of the study in our review   there be a strong
need for additional research on this topic   and not only on the
six type of intervention describe in our review   when
look at available literature concern the treatment of
gdm and the prevention of t2d   it be plausible that vitamin d
could help to decrease the risk of gdm 42 43 but we do not
 
oostdam et al  
find any control trial that evaluate this intervention  
furthermore   there be a need for good quality rct with adequate sample size to assess the effect of all type of intervention   it would be beneficial if in addition to assess
the effect of the intervention alone such trial focus also
on the add effect of different intervention and on identify the intervention that cause the great effect with the
least cost  
although more evidence be require   the available datum
suggest that dietary counseling   advice on an lgi diet   or an
exercise program could be beneficial and that probiotic
might be promise   overall   well design study   provide detailed   high quality datum be require before conclusion can be draw about the good intervention for the
prevention of gdm in pregnant woman

gestational diabetes diagnosis
moderate level of peripheral insulin resistance and
hyperinsulinemia be normal occurrence during pregnancy and be accompany by increase level of the
hormone prolactin   lactogen   and estrogen 18 these
process ensure a sufficient nutrient supply to the fetus
and prevent low maternal blood glucose level by counteract the action of insulin 18 insulin secretion increase early on in pregnancy   although insulin
sensitivity may or may not change during this time   by
mid pregnancy   and until the end of the third trimester  
insulin sensitivity begin to decline 2 a normal response
by the maternal pancreatic islet be to augment insulin
production   in gdm   the balance between the increase
insulin resistance and maternal insulin production be
disrupt   and the pancrea can not meet the increase

lack of consensus that lead to significant difference in the
report prevalence   which pose a challenge for the application of research finding obtain use different

gdm not only have a tremendous impact on the
health of the mother   it also have long lasting consequence on the health of the child   pregnant woman with
gdm and their unborn child have a high risk of

miscarriage   macrosomia   and intrauterine growth retardation 1 woman with gdm be also at risk of postpartum complication   include the development of overt
diabete and gdm in subsequent pregnancy 12 the effect on the child bear to woman with gdm be of
utmost concern due to the increase risk of a range of
short   and long term morbidity   in the postnatal period
and depend on the severity of the maternal hyperglycemia   these can range from high birth weight   serum cpeptide   and newborn percent body fat above the 90th

origin of health and disease hypothesis   the adverse intrauterine environment create by gdm be hypothesize
to result in epigenetic change that predispose the offspring to develop metabolic disease later in life   in
turn   these trait be transmit to the following generation   thereby perpetuate the vicious cycle of metabolic

to be interpret in the light of important limitation
such as use different diagnostic criterion for gdm assessment   failure to assess physical activity that be perform outside the program   lack of standardized

composition   diet   and lifestyle be the most effective solution in many setting   particularly in low   and
middle income country 6 consider that there be a
high level of controversy with regard to the dietary prevention of gdm   it be imperative to carefully design and
conduct rct that be sufficiently powered to well

sensitivity   thus   robust plasticity of
   cell function in the face of progressive
insulin resistance be the hallmark of normal glucose regulation during pregnancy  
like all form of hyperglycemia  
gdm result from an endogenous insulin
supply that be inadequate to meet tissue
insulin demand   inadequate insulin secretion be most easily demonstrate in late
pregnancy   when insulin requirement
be uniformly high and differ only slightly
between normal woman and woman with
gdm   2   8    by contrast   insulin response to nutrient be much low in
woman with gdm   2 3 5 9    one potential pathophysiology for gdm be a limitation in pancreatic    cell reserve that
become manifest as hyperglycemia only
when insulin secretion do not increase
to match the increase insulin need of
late pregnancy   at first glance   study
conduct outside of pregnancy seem to
support that scenario   insulin level be
often similar between woman without
and with a history of gdm   3 7 11    suggest that inadequate insulin secretion
in the gdm group be limit to pregnancy   however   woman with a history of
gdm be usually considerably more insulin resistant than nonpregnant normal
woman   thus   insulin level would be
high in the prior gdm patient if their
   cell function be normal   the similarity of insulin level in the face of differ
insulin resistance reveal at a qualitative
level a    cell defect in woman with prior
gdm   the defect can be quantify by express insulin level relative to each individual s degree of insulin resistance  
use the hyperbolic relationship that exist between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion   12 15    that approach

what be gdm  
 
overall insulin level in the gdm group  
   cell compensation for insulin resistance be reduce to a similar degree during
and after pregnancy in both study   by 39
and 47    respectively   in the homko
study and by 69 and 62    respectively   in
our study    these finding   which be
consistent with the early study of catalano et al    3 9    provide evidence that
gdm represent detection of chronic
   cell dysfunction   rather than development of relative insulin deficiency as insulin
resistance increase during pregnancy  
thus   the routine glucose screening that be
conduct during pregnancy serve as a
useful tool for detection of woman with
chronic and   as we will see below   often
worsen    cell dysfunction  
while the full array of cause of    cell
dysfunction in human remain to be determine   clinical classification of diabete outside of pregnancy be base on three
general category of dysfunction   1   occur on a background of chronic insulin resistance   2   autoimmune   and 3  
monogenic   there be evidence that each of
these three category contribute to
   cell dysfunction in case of gdm   a fact
that be not surprising give that gdm be
detect by what amount to population
screen for elevated glucose level in
young woman  
gdm on background of chronic
insulin resistance
during pregnancy   when gdm be diagnose   insulin sensitivity be quite low in
normal woman and in woman with gdm  
s106
 
nonetheless   precise measure of insulin
sensitivity apply in the third trimester
have reveal slightly great insulin resistance in woman with gdm than in normal pregnant woman   the additional
resistance occur for insulin s action to
stimulate glucose disappearance   2 3  
and to suppress both glucose production
  2 3   and fatty acid level   2    abatement
of the physiological insulin resistance of
pregnancy after delivery lead to a great
increase in insulin sensitivity in normal
woman than in woman with gdm   in
other word   the abatement reveal a separate chronic form of insulin resistance in
the woman who have gdm   this find
of great insulin resistance in woman
with prior gdm have be consistent
across study in which whole body insulin sensitivity have be measure directly
  8 10 11 16   19    it indicate that most  
although probably not all   see below   
woman who develop gdm have chronic
insulin resistance   serial measurement of
insulin sensitivity start before pregnancy have document insulin resistance before conception and at the
begin of the second trimester in
woman with gdm   3 9   
give that gdm represent a cross
section of glucose intolerance in young
woman   mechanism that lead to chronic
insulin resistance in gdm be likely as
varied as they be in the general population   obesity be a common antecedent of
gdm   and many of the biochemical mediator of insulin resistance that occur in
obesity have be identify in small stud

  27    and overexpression of membrane glycoprotein 1   29    all of which could contribute to the observe reduction in insulinmediate glucose transport   to date  
study of cellular mechanism of insulin resistance in gdm have be small   and it be
not clear whether any of these abnormality
represent universal or even common abnormality underlie the chronic insulin resistance that be very frequent in gdm  
the datum present in fig   1 and serial
study of insulin sensitivity and secretion
before and during pregnancy   3 9   reveal
that many woman with gdm have the
ability to change their insulin secretion
reciprocally to short term change in insulin sensitivity   however   they do so
along an insulin sensitivity secretion relationship that be   40   70   low   I e   
40   70   less insulin for any degree of insulin resistance   than the relationship in
normal woman   thus   many woman with
gdm do not have a fix limitation in
their insulin secretory capacity   rather  
they have insulin secretion that be low relative to their insulin sensitivity   but
acutely responsive to change sensitivity   it be important to distinguish these
short term relationship between insulin
sensitivity and secretion   which occur
over several month   from change that
occur over the course of year   fig   2   
the short term change reflect normal
physiology   albeit offset to insulin level
that be low than normal for the degree
of insulin resistance   the long term

type 2 diabetes   observation by our
group in hispanic woman with prior

that hispanic woman who develop gdm
do not tolerate high level of insulin secretion for prolong period of time   the

although detailed physiological study
be lack in these woman   they most
likely have inadequate insulin secretion
result from autoimmune damage to
and destruction of pancreatic    cell  
they appear to have evolve type 1 diabete that come to clinical attention
through routine glucose screen during
pregnancy   whether pregnancy can actually initiate or accelerate islet direct autoimmunity be unknown   the frequency
of anti islet and anti gad antibodie in
gdm tend to parallel ethnic trend in the

methodological issue
in assess trend in
gdm prevalence    there be
several important issue in study
trend in gdm   the first issue be the definition of gdm   which have be describe
as carbohydrate intolerance of vary degree of severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy   24 25    this
definition make it difficult to distinguish
between undiagnosed diabetes exist
before pregnancy and hyperglycemia
induce by pregnancy   reason for this
difficulty be the fact that woman in childbeare age be usually not screen for diabetes   epidemiological study that
include an unselected large sample of
woman with blood glucose concentration test before pregnancy and follow through pregnancy have not be
perform yet   unrecognized diabetes
before pregnancy could be rule out in
woman with abnormal glucose tolerance
during pregnancy if glucose tolerance be
show to return to normal at postpartum  
however   study of trend in gdm with
systematic datum on postpartum glucose
tolerance status be lack   when trend
in gdm be examine   it be also important
to know the penetration of screen for
gdm over time to use the correct denominator   an increase in gdm screen
from the beginning to the middle of the
1990 have be report   11    if study
be not able to include in the denominator
only woman who be screen for
gdm   increase prevalence of gdm over
a time period might be the consequence
of increase screening activity during that
period of time   finally   and most importantly   a difficulty in assess true trend
in gdm be represent by change in the
recommend diagnostic criterion   study

ecent datum show that gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   prevalence
have increase by   10   100   in
several race ethnicity group during the
past 20 year   a true increase in the prevalence of gdm   aside from its adverse
consequence for infant in the newborn
period   might also reflect or contribute to
the current pattern of increase diabete
and obesity   especially in the offspring  
therefore   the public health aspect of increase gdm need more attention  
the frequency of gdm usually reflect the frequency of type 2 diabete in
the underlying population   1 2    establish risk factor for gdm be advanced
maternal age   obesity   and family history
of diabetes   3    unquestionably   there be
ethnic difference in the prevalence of
gdm   4   15    in the u s    native americans   asians   hispanic   and africanamerican woman be at high risk for
gdm than non hispanic white woman

prevalence be find to be high in

  7    gdm prevalence be also high in
aboriginal woman than in nonaboriginal woman   12    in europe   gdm
have be find to be more common
among asian woman than among european woman   16    the proportion of
pregnancy complicate by gdm in
asian country have be report to be
low than the proportion observe in
asian woman live in other continent
 
only woman who deliver   and therefore
they calculate the   prevalence   of gdm at
delivery   for simplicity   the term   prevalence   of gdm will be use for all study  
since the gdm cumulative incidence estimate be similar to the prevalence estimate   give the small number of preggnancie that be screen but do not
deliver an infant

in gdm prevalence   there be six study
from which we can learn about these

increase in gdm prevalence   however  
increase vary widely across study  
from 16   in montana to 127   in the

alence among asian woman   the
colorado study first report a cohort effect on gdm prevalence   woman who
be bear more recently be at increase risk for gdm diagnosis than
woman bear early   however   no difference in gdm diagnosis be find between the two most recent birth cohort  
a recent report from montana
show that the prevalence of gdm   as
report in the birth certificate record  
increase by   10   among white woman
and by   21   among american indian
woman between 2000 and 2003   variation of penetration of screen over time
and criterion for gdm diagnosis be not

an early report from melbourne   7  
compare the prevalence of gdm in
one large maternity hospital in 1979   
1983 and 1984   1988   the author
demonstrate a doubling in the gdm
prevalence that appear to apply similarly to mother who be bear in many
different country and currently live in
australia   however   the author do not
adjust for the change age distribution
among the pregnant woman over the time
period   and possible variation in penetration of screening be not assess   therefore   the doubling in gdm prevalence
should be interpret with caution  
finally   a recent study   15   examine
gdm prevalence as report in the new
york city birth certificate record in 1990
and again in 2001   the prevalence of diagnose gdm increase by   46    and
increment be observe in all race  
ethnicity group   however   possible variation in penetration of screening or in
criterion use to diagnose gdm be not
document   also in this study   the prevalence of gdm be high among asian
woman  
why be gdm
increase     all six study of
trend in gdm conduct in different
population and with different methodology consistently report an increase in
gdm in all race ethnicity group   suggest that the observe increase in gdm
prevalence may be true   however   none of
the six study could distinguish between
woman who have be reclassify postpartum as have underlying diabetes
from those who return to normal glucose tolerance   high relative increase
in young woman suggest that the prevalence of risk factor for gdm may have
increase more in young woman than
 
in old woman   however   none of the
study have information on maternal obesity   the most important modifiable risk
factor for gdm   3    and therefore none of
the study be able to assess whether the
observe increase in gdm prevalence
be explain by concomitant increase
in maternal obesity   it be worth note
some result that might suggest a possible
plateau in the increase of gdm prevalence   the northern california kaiser
permanente study   11   show that the
increase in gdm prevalence level off
after 1997   although woman who be
bear more recently have a high prevalence of gdm than woman who be
bear later   no difference in the prevalence of gdm between the two most recent birth cohort be observe   the
lack of datum on maternal obesity make it
impossible to explain whether these finding would be explain by a plateau of
maternal obesity after 1997   or whether
maternal obesity have increase less in the
young generation   or whether the increase prevalence of gdm in woman
from young birth cohort be independent of the effect of obesity   in summary  
there be a need for large epidemiological
study that assess prepregnancy and or
postpartum glucose tolerance status to
evaluate the contribution of underlie
glucose intolerance in the development of
gdm   there be also the need of additional
study that assess prepregnancy obesity
and possible gdm risk factor operate
before childbeare to well understand
trend in the prevalence of gdm and plan
prevention strategy   the high prevalence of gdm among asian woman need
further investigation   epidemiological
datum on modifiable risk factor of gdm
be sparse   besides obesity   a major gdm
risk factor   there be a suggestion that physical inactivity   31    diet high in saturated
fat   32    and smoke   33   be associate
with increase risk for gdm or recurrent
gdm   it be critical to know the risk factor
for gdm not only to well understand
trend in gdm   but also to allow early
identification of woman at risk and
prevention of this common pregnancy

two most recent cohort   birth year
1966   1975 and 1976   1985    among

birth cohort   birth year 1946   1955    a
cohort effect be not present at all among
hispanic woman  
the south australia study   12   examine the prevalence of gdm between
1988 and 1999   an increase of 72   in
gdm prevalence among non aboriginal
woman be observe   whereas a small
increase of 12   be observe among aboriginal woman   the penetration of
screen over time be unknown and
the yearly denominator include all pregnancy   regardless of screen   result
from the 75 g 2 h oral glucose tolerance
test be not available   therefore   the author be not able to use the same glucose threshold for the definition of gdm
over time   the author estimate that
gdm be diagnose accord to the
australasian diabete in pregnancy society criterion during the first 5 year of the
study and by the slightly low 1985
world health organization   30   plasma
glucose threshold from 1993 through
2000   therefore   some of the observe increase in gdm prevalence might be a result of the change in the criterion for gdm
diagnosis or variation in the penetration
of screen over time  
the colorado kaiser permanente
study   13   observe an increase in gdm
prevalence of   95   between 1994 and
2002   however   this large increase should
be interpret with caution   the pregnancy cohort be identify through a
clinical perinatal database that do not include laboratory datum   it be assume that
during the entire study period   the clinical
database classify woman as have
gdm if they meet the national diabetes
data group   27   criterion   it be possible that
the large increase in gdm prevalence be
in part because   after 1998   some clinician may have diagnose gdm accord to the carpenter and coustan criterion  
as recommend by the proceeding of
the fourth international workshopconference on gdm   25   publish in
august 1998   the penetration of screen over time be not well document  
nevertheless   the colorado study show
a similar increase in gdm in all race

objective    to examine risk perception for diabetes among woman with history of
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   
 
future pregnancy   and one fifth do not
believe they be at risk for diabetes  
qualitative work in several high risk
group such as the pima indians   7   and
mexican americans   8   suggest that these
woman may believe that gdm do not
pose a problem after delivery  
theoretical model suggest that risk
perception may be an important determinant of behavioral change   9    in the case
of diabetes prevention   high and more
accurate perception of risk might encourage a healthy lifestyle   include a
healthy diet and adequate physical activity   in contrast   underestimate of risk
might act as a barrier to preventive behavior and could therefore be a target for
behavioral intervention   however   the
association between risk perception and
behavior have be inconsistent   with
some study demonstrate an association between risk perception and preventive behavior   9   but other not
demonstrate these association   10 11   
one explanation for these inconsistency
be that the link between behavior and risk
perception be poorly specify   12    another explanation be that other factor that
may affect risk perception be not adequately account for in the analysis  
these factor include knowledge of diabetes risk factor   perceive personal control   or the degree to which one believe
that risk be modify by one s action   and
optimistic bias   or one s assessment of
their risk compare with other like they
  13   
to our knowledge   no report have
explore the way in which diabetes risk
perception be associate with preventive
behavior in woman with history of
gdm   particularly after account for
knowledge of diabetes risk factor   perceive personal control   and optimistic
bias   therefore   we test several hypothesis   woman who have poor lifestyle behavioral practice would have great
perception of risk   woman with great
risk perception should report plan to reduce their diabetes risk by initiate lifestyle improvement in the near future  
woman who recently improve their lifestyle behavior should have low risk
perception than woman who do not I m  
 
 
risk perception for diabete in gdm

research design and
method    study participant
be woman enrol in an academic
manage care plan and identify as having have a gdm pregnancy within the past
5 year through a gdm delivery code
  icd 9 code 648 8   or outpatient diagnostic code 648 83   undelivered   or
648 84   deliver   and with at least one
outpatient or hospitalization health care
utilization for any reason   gdm specific
or otherwise   during the year before the
survey   we conduct computer assist
telephone interview   and woman be
give the option of fill out a write
survey if they choose   woman be exclude if they deny having have gdm   if
they be currently pregnant with the index pregnancy   if they be unable to give
inform consent   or if they have develop diabete since their gdm delivery  
for a final sample size of 217   survey
be complete by 98   of eligible respondent who could be contact   however   potentially eligible patient could
not be reach   if patient who be unreachable have the same rate of eligibility
as those successfully contact   the survey response rate would have be 65

modifier of risk perception
measurement of optimistic bias   personal
control   knowledge of diabetes risk factor   and belief in the benefit and barrier to lifestyle modification be adapt
from the risk perception survey for develop diabete   a risk perception instrument use in the diabetes prevention
program   15   and also administer to
physician   16    the psychometric property and scoring of these scale have
be previously describe   15 16    the
personal control and optimistic bias subscale be grade on a scale of 1   4 and
average so that great score reflect
great personal control and great optimistic bias for not develop diabete
  15 16    knowledge of diabetes risk factor question be ascertain after risk
factor relate to race ethnicity   age  
physical activity and diet   and family history   this subscale have a score range
from 1 to 11   with high score reflect
great knowledge of risk factor   woman s perception of the benefit of and
barrier to preventive behavior be measure use three item from the risk perception survey for develop diabete  
these question ask woman to report
their belief regard the effort require
to engage in a diet and exercise program  
the benefit of a diet and exercise program   and specific belief about prevention of diabete with exercise and diet  
the response to these item be average so that high score indicate great
belief in the benefit of preventive activity
and low score indicate great barrier  
since these scale be originally develop in population without gdm   and
because they be also slightly modify
from their original format   we recalculate cronbach s    coefficient for each
scale   the personal control subscale
  cronbach s      0 72 in our sample   and
knowledge of diabetes risk factor subscale   cronbach s      0 70 in our sample   be not modify   we modify the
optimistic bias subscale   cronbach s     
0 65 in our sample   to reflect the fact that
all of our survey respondent be woman  
the belief in the benefit and behavior
question be not originally design to
be measurement of the same construct
but rather as a summary measure for the
benefit of and barrier to action   so reliability be calculate neither in the original instrument nor in our sample  
 
risk perception and lifestyle
modification
we assess risk perception for develop diabete use the item    what do you
think your risk or chance be for get
diabete over the next 10 year    woman
could report   almost no chance     a slight
chance     a moderate chance    or   a high
chance    to account for the possibility
that woman who plan to make lifestyle modification change would paradoxically have low perception of risk
for future diabetes   12    we also ask    if
you don t change your lifestyle behavior  
such as diet or exercise   what be your risk
or chance of get diabete over the next
10 year    we also inquire about
change in diabetes relate lifestyle behavior with the question    have you recently make change in any lifestyle
behavior that you believe will lower your
chance of get diabete    finally   we
ask about plan to modify lifestyle in
the near future with the question    be
you plan to make change in any lifestyle behavior in the near future that you

physical activity and diet
self report leisure time physical activity be assess use a single item
adapt from the monica   multinational monitoring of trend and determinant in cardiovascular disease   physical
activity instrument   17   and validate in
project direct   diabete intervention
reach and educate community
together    18    woman be ask
which of the following four activity level
well describe their present leisure time
activity   none   only light physical activity
in most week   vigorous activity for at
least 20 min once or twice per week   and
vigorous activity for at least 20 min three
or more time per week   daily consumption of fruit and vegetable be calculate from question measure intake of
fresh   can   frozen   or dry preparation   for this report   base on the distribution of response   woman be
group into the follow category  
consumption of less than three serving of
fruit or vegetable per day   consumption
of three to less than five serving of fruit
or vegetable per day   and consumption
of at least five serving of fruit or vegetable per day  
statistical analysis
in the first stage of our analysis   we examine whether woman who engage in
  risky   behavior have high perceive
risk by examine the association between current physical activity and diet
  independent variable   and risk perception   dependent variable    for the purpose of this analysis    no chance   and
  slight chance   be categorize as   low  
risk perception   and   moderate chance  
and   high chance   be categorize as
  high   risk perception   use multivariate
logistic regression model   we adjust

with the primary dependent and independent variable   as well as personal
control   optimistic bias   knowledge of diabetes risk factor   and belief in the
benefit of and barrier to lifestyle modification   candidate participant characteristic include demographic variable
  age   race   education   and income    cardiovascular risk factor   family history of
diabete and current diabetes   history of
dyslipidemia   history of hypertension
outside of pregnancy   or cigarette smoking    current bmi   and pregnancy characteristic   breast feeding   insulin use

conclusion    the traditional
paradigm for the gdm pregnancy focus
on perinatal outcome   yet gdm may also
serve as an indicator of future maternal
glucose intolerance and a   teachable moment   during which woman may be
alert to their increase risk   in turn   this
increase risk perception could potentially encourage the adoption of preventive behavior   in this report    90   of
woman with history of gdm recognize
that gdm be a risk factor for future diabetes   but less than one fifth of woman
believe they themselves be at high risk
for diabetes because they intend to improve their behavior in the near future  
even when assume their lifestyle would
not change   only a little more than onethird of woman believe themselves to be
at high risk   in accord with theoretical
model of risk perception   we find that
 
woman who have great perception of
risk more often intend to improve their
behavior in the future   our study be
unique in that no previous report have
examine these association in woman
with history of gdm   particularly with
ground in risk perception theory and
with adjustment for potential bias include woman s perception of personal
control   optimistic bias   and knowledge
of diabetes risk factor  
we also find that woman with history of gdm who have great perception of diabetes risk more often have risk
factor associate with diabetes   such as
family history   great bmi   and short
duration of breast feeding   20    while
insulin use during pregnancy do not
meet criterion for significance   p    0 05  
for its association with risk perception  
there be a trend toward significance   I e   
more than half of woman who perceive
that they have a high chance for develop future diabete use insulin   whereas
only   20   of woman who perceive that
they have a low chance for develop future diabete use insulin    we speculate
that the use of subcutaneous injection for
great glucose level may have increase
woman s impression of their disease severity during pregnancy   in addition   the
additional teaching and monitoring that
may accompany insulin use may have also
contribute to great risk perception  
these woman have less optimistic bias
  I e    they be more pessimistic or more
realistic about their chance of get disease in general and diabete specifically
compare with other like they    however   while great risk perception be
associate with less fruit and vegetable consumption   we do not find any association between self report physical
activity and risk perception   more comprehensive measure of activity may have
capture an association   although we examine alternate measure of activity
such as number of hour walk   and no
association be observe   woman may
not perceive activity to be as strong a risk
factor for diabetes as weight or family history   although we do not ask about their
perception of the strength of risk factor
for diabetes   only if woman believe it
be a risk factor   we do not observe an
association between recent modification
of behavior and risk perception   it be possible that any improvement may have
be inadequate to lead to any real or perceive risk reduction   although threequarter of woman state that they have
recently improve their physical activity
 
diabetes care   volume 30   number 9   september 2007
 
and dietary practice   less than one third
report the recommend level of vigorous physical activity and less than onethird report optimal fruit and vegetable
consumption   also   woman who already
practice healthy behavior would not
necessarily report recent behavior modification   but they would report low risk
perception   thus minimize any association   among woman who have optimal
behavioral practice   recent modification
of behavior be still not associate with
low perception of risk  
previous study of the association
between risk perception and behavior in
other population have be inconsistent  
potentially due to inconsistency in risk
theory and or lack of adequate adjustment for risk modifier   9   11    in particular   in cross sectional analysis   it be
difficult to interpret an association between risk perception and behavior because poor behavior may increase risk
perception or increase risk perception
may negatively impact behavior   while
our datum be collect at a single point in
time   we take care to distinguish between
past behavior   current behavior and risk
perception   and plan to change future
behavior   ideally   perception of risk and
report of behavior would be collect
longitudinally   such analysis would reduce bias associate with social desirability and allow for determination of
whether actual behavior improve or deteriorate over time   rather than just plan
to improve behavior or recall of recent
behavior change   such analysis would
also allow more comprehensive model
rather than separate testing of multiple
hypothesis  
our study be also limit in that we
examine a select and   in several way

ure normal pregnancy   a gradual deterioration
of glucose tolerance take place so that the
plasma glucose value after   for instance   a glucose load or a meal be high than outside pregnancy 12 in most normal pregnant woman   glucose tolerance
stay within the normal range   but in 1 2   it deteriorate
sufficiently for the diagnostic criterion of diabetes mellitus to
be fulfil 3 if the fast glucose concentration in pregnancy
remain normal and the oral glucose tolerance test   ogtt  
return to normal postpartum   the condition be term gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   4
the glucose intolerance of gdm be usually mild   but nevertheless it mean a high incidence of complication during
pregnancy5 and   in some case   an increase perinatal mortality and morbidity of the infant 6 as well   gdm also considerably increase the woman s risk of develop manifest
diabete later in life 7 thus   it be important to recognize and
to treat this disease  
an unavoidable prerequisite for rational treatment of gdm
be a significant knowledge of the pathophysiologic background for the condition   why pregnancy be capable of induce this temporary diabetic state be still partly unknown  
among the possible explanation be reduce insulin secretion   increase insulin degradation   increase secretion of

great increment in insulin response compare with postpartum than those find in gestational diabetic subject   figure 1    920 however   due to the pregnancy associate retardation in the absorption of a mixed meal   it be difficult to
directly compare the insulin response obtain in pregnancy and postpartum   this problem have be circumvent
by the i v   infusion of appropriate quantity of a solution of
amino acid   in both normal pregnant woman and in gestational diabetic subject   almost identical plasma amino acid
concentration curve be obtain in late pregnancy and
postpartum 21 the insulin response to amino acid be significantly increase in late pregnancy in both group 21
after the ingestion of triglyceride   plasma insulin remain
unchanged in normal pregnant woman and in gestational
diabetic subject   figure 1   22
these result demonstrate that the beta cell sensitivity to
glucose and amino acid   but not to lipid   be significantly
enhance in pregnancy   the insulin secretory capacity of
normal weight gestational diabetic subject be generally less
than that of normal pregnant woman   as well   gestational
diabetic woman exhibit an increase insulin response to oral
glucose and amino acid when compare with postpartum  
so they be only relatively insulin deficient in pregnancy compare with normal pregnant control  
recent human2324 study have demonstrate that insulin
degradation be unaffected by pregnancy   the decrease in
glucose tolerance in gestation can not   therefore   be ascribe
to an acceleration of insulin degradation in this state

in late pregnancy   the fast serum insulin concentration be
almost twice as high as postpartum   both in normal pregnant
woman and in gestational diabetic subject 12 9 12 normal
pregnant woman and gestational diabetic subject have
comparable fast insulin level 1u2 and fast serum proinsulin be also similarly elevate in late pregnancy in both
group 1314 during gestation   however   serum insulin rise in
parallel with proinsulin in both group   for which reason the
proportion of total insulin immunoreactivity constitute by
proinsulin remain constant 1314
during an ogtt   high insulin level be reach in the
late normal and in the gdm pregnancy when compare with
postpartum   figure 1   19 12 however   even though the insulin
response in absolute term be almost similar in the normal
woman and in the gestational diabetic subject   the insulin
response per unit of glycemic stimulus   the insulinogenic
index   be significantly great in the normal pregnant woman
than in the gestational diabetic subject 11
the insulin response to oral glucose be not increase in
late pregnancy only as a result of the high prevail
serum   glucose level   thus   the insulinogenic index be increase by about 90   and 40   in late normal and in gdm
pregnancy   respectively 11 moreover   when glucose be infuse intravenously   I v    at rate that result in identical elevation of plasma glucose in normal and gestational diabetic
woman in late pregnancy and postpartum   the insulin response be find to be increase approximately four time in
normal late pregnancy15 and approximately three time in late
gdm pregnancy16 when compare with postpartum  
the ingestion of a protein rich meal or single amino acid

the fast molar insulin glucagon ratio be increase in latenormal and in gestational diabetic pregnancy 11 whereas the
opposite finding be a characteristic of insulin dependent diabete  
after oral glucose   glucagon suppression below fast
level be either unchanged25 or exaggerated1112 in late normal and gestational diabetic pregnancy   figure 2    these
finding contrast the lack of suppressibility of glucagon during hyperglycemia find in nonpregnant diabetic subject  
the increase suppressibility of glucagon during hyperglycemia seem to be due to the high plasma glucose level
reach after glucose administration in this state   thus   if
plasma glucose be similarly increase by grade I v   glucose
infusion in the same woman in late pregnancy and postpartum   identical suppression of plasma glucagon below
the fast level be see in normal women15 and in gestational diabetic subject 16
oral intake of alanine elicit a great rise in plasma glucagon in the normal woman investigate in their late pregnancy as compare with postpartum 18 despite the rise in
plasma glucagon   blood glucose remain unchanged at
both occasion 18 this be probably due to the concomitant
increase in plasma insulin   which be much high in pregnancy than postpartum 18
the glucagon response to a protein rich meal have be
report to be either reduce 2 or unaffected17 19 by normal
pregnancy and to be unaffected by gestational diabetic
pregnancy20   figure 2    the discrepancy be probably due
to the fact that meal often differ with regard to the content
of protein   sugar   and fat   moreover   glucose and fat may
both modulate glucagon secretion after stimulation by the
amino acid component of the ingest meal   more easily
interpretable datum have be obtain by grade I v   amino
acid infusion   which lead to almost identical plasma amino
acid level in pregnancy and postpartum in normal and gestational diabetic woman 21 the glucagon response be sim

ilar in pregnancy and postpartum in the normal   whereas in
the gestational diabetic subject   an enhance glucagon response to amino acid be find in pregnancy as compare
both to postpartum and to the pregnant normal woman 21
the physiologic implication of the high glucagon level
reach in the gestational diabetic subject after I v   amino
acid be unknown as be the reason why these difference in
glucagon level be not see after the ingestion of a proteinrich meal 1920
oral intake of triglyceride do not influence plasma glucagon level in normal pregnant woman or gestational diabetic subject   figure 2   22

conclusion
 
the datum present in this review clearly point to pregnancy
as a state of insulin resistance   the cellular basis for the
insulin resistance of pregnancy and how it be bring about
be not yet fully understand   most pregnant woman be able
to counteract the insulin resistance in pregnancy by increase their insulin secretion   however   when the capacity of
insulin secretion be not sufficiently large to meet the resistance   glucose intolerance develop and the woman develop gestational diabetes

with respect to gdm   the heart of the matter be the
relationship between the degree of glucose intolerance
and or hyperglycemia and the risk of adverse maternal  
fetal   and neonatal outcome   that risk may be affect by
other factor that may independently influence glucose
tolerance   these factor include maternal age   adiposity  
ethnicity   stage of pregnancy   past obstetric experience  
family history of diabetes   and the taking of certain medication   study seek to explore the importance of glucose
tolerance in pregnancy should also take these factor into

recommendation of the previous workshop conference
  table 1 and 2   be endorse with some modification  
1   a plasma glucose measurement   11 1 mm outside the
context of a formal glucose challenge test or a truly
fast plasma glucose   7 8 mm suggest the diabetic state and warrant further investigation  
2   laboratory measurement of plasma glucose concentration be appropriately perform with enzymatic assay technique   and current diagnostic value be
base on the use of such method   test strip and
reflectance meter be not sufficiently precise and
accurate for screening and diagnosis  
3   the recommendation for universal 50 g 1 h glucose
challenge testing at 24 28 wk gestation   table 2  
should not preclude early testing depend on the
circumstance  
4   it should be recognize that the recommend plasma
glucose threshold of 7 8 mm for further testing after the
50 g 1 h challenge test be arrive at by consensus  
datum that have become available since the last workshop conference suggest that a proportion of individual who meet the recommend criterion for gdm
have screen level below this value   however   their
detection require a substantial increase in the number
of full glucose tolerance test perform  
5   it be acknowledge that the adjustment recommend by the national diabetes data group   nddg  
for the conversion of whole blood glucose concentration   use by o sullivan and mahan to define criterion
for oral glucose tolerance test interpretation   to equivalent plasma glucose value may result in some overcorrection   nevertheless   it appear unlikely that the
continue use of these criterion have a significant adverse clinical impact   because it be hope that international agreement will soon be reach as to
appropriate and globally acceptable diagnostic criterion   it seem inadvisable to introduce minor corrective
modification at present   it have also be suggest
that the presence of one abnormal value on a glucose
tolerance test may merit further evaluation   because it
may be associate with increase morbidity  
recommendation for the future   the summary of the
second international workshop conference on gestational
diabetes mellitus suggest that the 75 g glucose challenge will eventually become universally employ   replace 100   and 50 g test   after sufficient experience during
pregnancy have be secure   some study have be
 
carry out   but to achieve consensus   there be urgent need
for a comprehensive exploration of the problem  
in addition to the difference in the glucose load use in
test   there be several contending method for assign
glucose tolerance status in pregnancy   the approach recommend by the nddg and the participant in the three
international workshop conference on gestational diabetes mellitus be base on value derive from a population of
pregnant woman   another approach   promulgate by the
world health organization   who    be base on the method
and criterion recommend for use in nonpregnant adult  
these two method utilize different glucose load and different sample time point   the nddg method divide the
pregnant population into two category   normal glucose
tolerance and gestational diabete   whereas the who approach interpose an intermediate category of impaired
glucose tolerance   in the absence of internationally agree
methodology   some comparability of datum could be
achieve by carefully design study relate the result
of test with one glucose challenge to those of the other to
enable the direct comparison of vary degree of glucose
tolerance   it be clear that different population manifest
diabete in the nonpregnant state at widely disparate rate  
therefore   it should not be surprising that gestational diabetes will also differ in prevalence   nevertheless   to achieve
comparability   it be crucial that a fix framework of diagnostic criterion be apply to all population

more widespread testing and identification of gdm as
well as intensive management appear to have be associate with a decrease in overall morbidity in the infant of the
mother with gdm   the likelihood of intrauterine fetal death in
a patient with appropriately treat gdm be not significantly
high than that in the general population   the most important perinatal concern in offspring of mother with gdm
remain excessive fetal growth   macrosomia   which primarily involve excessive weight for gestational age    which be
observe two to three time more often than expect   this
figure may be even high in patient not recognize or
inadequately treat   although maternal hyperglycemia
may contribute to fetal hyperglycemia   hyperinsulinemia  
and excessive growth   presentation at the workshop conference suggest an etiologic role for various other factor
that may include abnormal maternal plasma level of lipid
and amino acid   clinical estimation of fetal size and asymmetric growth by serial ultrasonography may improve the
identification of the macrosomic infant in pregnancy complicate by gdm  
consequence of excessive fetal growth include birth
trauma and maternal morbidity from operative delivery   at
present   the cesarean section rate be increase in patient
with gdm   in large part to avoid birth trauma   other significant neonatal morbidity include hypoglycemia   hypocalcemia   hyperbilirubinemia   and polycythemia   the incidence
of these morbidity be dependent not only on maternal
metabolic control but on gestational age as well   be more
common in the preterm infant   all infant of mother with
gdm should be evaluate for these problem   although a
precise definition of hypoglycemia in newborn infant remain ambiguous   identification of neonatal hypoglycemia
should not be make solely with glucose reagent strip
because they be inaccurate at low glucose concentration  
gdm   with its onset in late pregnancy   be not associate with

other fetal growth factor such as insulinlike growth factor I
and ii in alter fetal development   and mechanism and
regulation of placental nutrient transfer   these study   by
provide a well understanding of the pathophysiology
associate with gdm   may lead to well diagnostic criterion

gdm be associate with an increase risk for later overt
diabete mellitus in the mother appear to be establish
beyond doubt   although most woman with gdm return to
normal glucose tolerance in the puerperium   woman in
whom gdm be diagnose should be educate regard
the symptom of overt diabetes mellitus and follow postpartum at regular interval by appropriate technique to
detect diabete early in its course   particularly in preparation
for any future pregnancy   they should be evaluate initially
at the first postpartum visit by a 2 h oral glucose tolerance

woman with impaired glucose tolerance or non insulindependent diabetes mellitus   require additional study  
when such agent be use   lipid metabolism as well as
glucose tolerance should be monitor closely   because all

glucose intolerance in pregnancy be but part of a broad
complex of metabolic disturbance   it may be that measurement of associate variable such as insulin or proinsulin  
lipid   or amino acid may improve the precision with which
the degree of risk may be assign in the individual case  
the value of such additional measurement should be
actively explore  
comparability also require the acceptance of common
definition for outcome variable   for example    macrosomia   be a term widely used but lack formal definition   the
actual birth weight relative to gestational age would be
preferable   it may be most appropriate to express birth
weight in relation to their own population norm   agree

neonatal hypoglycemia and hypertensive disorder  
the high priority should be give to effort to develop
international consensus on method and definition

international workshop conference on gestational diabetes
mellitus   3    the panel recommend close surveillance of
mother and fetus in all instance of gdm   maternal monitoring should be direct toward evaluate fasting and postprandial circulate glucose level   in addition to the use of
venous plasma   the self monitoring of capillary blood glucose   smbg   have be useful in allow the woman to
participate in her own management   smbg may contribute
to behavior modification in management   it be note that
the utility of smbg in the patient with mild gdm   not
require insulin   although reasonable and logical   have not
be formally prove and its cost and benefit require
study   other factor   e g    age of patient   gestational age at
time of diagnosis of gdm   and degree of oral glucose
tolerance test abnormality   also need to be consider in
management decision  
nutritional counseling be the cornerstone of the management of all woman with gdm and be base on the standard
nutritional recommendation for pregnant woman   some
revision in the advice for nutrient intake have be introduce in the 1990 national academy of science nutrition
research council guideline for nutrition in pregnancy  
individualization of the diet depend on body weight of the
pregnant woman be recommend   an inverse relationship
between prepregnancy body weight and average weight
gain during pregnancy be consider appropriate with a
minimum increase of 7 kg recommend for the very obese
  body mass index    29 kg m2   and a proportionally great
weight gain   up to 18 kg   for those who be underweight
  body mass index    19 8 kg m2    routine nutritional supplementation be advise only for elemental iron   30 mg day to
be take with liquid other than milk   tea   or coffee   
regard specific nutritional management in gdm   it
appear that the use of hypocaloric diet may lessen the
amount of hyperglycemia and reduce weight of the baby at
birth   thus lessen the magnitude of macrosomia   however   level of free fatty acid and ketone may increase  
and it remain to be ascertain whether calorie restriction
might adversely affect the future health of the infant   whether
calorie restriction have long term benefit for the mother in
delay onset of impair glucose tolerance or subsequent
non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus also require
study   in addition   the efficacy of reduced calorie intake
versus insulin treatment in the management of obese woman
with mild gdm should be study   finally   consideration of
diet therapy need to include not only calorie intake but also
the amount and type of carbohydrate and its distribution in
relation to postprandial blood glucose level   other metabolite   and outcome criterion  
the use of insulin be now widely recommend when
standard dietary management do not consistently maintain normal fasting plasma glucose   5 8 mm and or the 2 h
postprandial plasma glucose   6 7 mm   datum from many
source indicate that the upper limit for normal value for
fast plasma glucose may be low than 5 8 mm when
specific assay method and gestational age be take into
account   in addition   result of several study that have
employ various technique for the selection of patient

the offspring   follow up study in human   the offspring

these risk be not confine to those who be overweight

recommendation for the future   more study be
need at birth   early and late childhood   and adolescence
to far assess these risk and to relate they to maternal
metabolic control and intrauterine development   such datum
may foster the development of strategy to prevent obesity
and reduce the risk of glucose intolerance in this population   long term animal study and more follow up study in
human be need to evaluate possible neurobehavioral

tor for gdm as well as a risk factor for the
recurrence of gdm   10   
until 1989   the rate of gdm in nova
scotia be   2    since 1989   the yearly
gdm rate have range from 2 1 to 3 4   
since the late 1980   universal screening
for gdm have be the recommend
standard of care in nova scotia   the increase in the rate of gdm likely reflect
increase compliance with this recommendation   before 1989   when universal
screening become the standard of care   it
be possible that some diagnosis of gdm
during index pregnancy have be
miss   however   the relatively low recurrence rate observe in this study be
not likely explain by the change in
screen during the study period   more
complete population screening would detect woman with less severe case of glucose intolerance who be probably less
prone to recurrence of gdm during a subsequent pregnancy   in addition   the criterion for diagnose gdm have not change
in nova scotia during the study period  
the datum from this study can not directly explain the relatively low recurrence rate find in this and other study  
because the perinatal database do not
include information on severity or control
of gdm   we could not assess the relationship between these factor and the likelihood of recurrence   however   if woman
with very severe case of gdm during the
initial pregnancy have be deter from
have a subsequent pregnancy   potential
case of recurrent gdm may have be
avoid   another possible explanation for
the relatively low recurrence rate be that
woman with gdm during an index pregnancy may have be motivate to make
dietary modification before and during
the subsequent pregnancy   thereby lower their risk of recurrent gdm  
the factor that be identify in this
study as predictive of recurrent gdm  
large infant birth weight and prepregnancy weight ⱖ190 lb   have be find
in previous study   large infant birth
weight during the index pregnancy may
be indicative of poor control and or poor
maternal diet or may reflect gdm severity   which may then predispose woman to
recurrent gdm   prepregnancy weight be
base on self report at the time of the first
prenatal visit   which make it susceptible
to misclassification   it have be suggest
that woman underreport their prepregnancy weight by 0 8 kg   on average   11

research design and methodsdin a cohort of 123 040 woman without recognize pregravid diabete who deliver baby between 1995 and 2006 at kaiser permanente
of northern california   we examine racial ethnic disparity in the prevalence of gdm by bmi
category and the population attributable risk   par   associate with overweight obesity  
resultsdamong all racial ethnic group   the age adjust prevalence of gdm increase
with increase bmi   kg m2   category   however   asian and filipina woman have a prevalence of
gdm of 9 9 and 8 5    respectively   at a bmi of 22 0 24 9 kg m2   whereas in hispanic   nonhispanic white   and african american woman   the prevalence of gdm be   8 0   at a high
bmi   such as 28 30   34 36   and   37 kg m2   respectively   the estimate par suggest that the
percentage of gdm that could be prevent if all pregnant woman be of normal weight   bmi
  25 0 kg m2   range from 65   for african american woman to only 23   among asian woman  
conclusionsdclinicians should be aware that the bmi threshold for increase risk of
gdm vary by racial ethnic group and that the risk be high even at relatively low bmi cutoff in
asian and filipina woman   asian woman may beneﬁt from different prevention strategy in
addition to weight management

world health organization propose a

conclusionsdin this multiethnic
cohort of woman undergo universal
screen for gdm   there be signiﬁcant
variation in the association between gdm
and bmi by racial ethnic group   asian and
filipina woman have an increase risk of
gdm at a low bmi cut point   particularly
as compare with non hispanic white and
african american woman   the estimate
par percentage for be overweight or
obese during pregnancy range from 23  
for asians to 65   for african americans  
suggest that the proportion of gdm that
could theoretically have be prevent if
all woman have be normal weight   deﬁne as a bmi   25 0 kg m2   be much low
among asian woman   even when a bmi
cutoff of 23 0 kg m2 be use   the par
among asian woman be only 35    signiﬁcantly low than that of other racial ethnic
group  
there be notable difference in the
epidemiology of type 2 diabetes and gdm  
especially in term of race ethnicity   where
 
african americans consistently have a
high prevalence of type 2 diabetes   23  
but not of gdm   17   when compare with
non hispanic white woman   we do not
ﬁnd that the low prevalence of gdm be
explain by the fact that more african
american woman be exclude as a result of pre exist diabete   in fact   a similar number of african american and
filipina woman be exclude as a result
of pre exist diabetes   prevalence of recognize pregravid diabete by racial ethnic
group   non hispanic white 1 4    african
american 2 2    hispanic 2 0    asian
1 3    and filipina 2 2    
the association between gdm and
bmi by racial ethnic group have not be
previously study   more be know about
the relationship between bmi and the risk
of type 2 diabetes by racial ethnic group  
the nurse   health study examine ethnicity   obesity   and type 2 diabete among
woman and find that the risk of diabetes
be high among all nonwhite racial

datum be prevalence   95   ci   
 
ethnic group compare with white  
each ﬁve unit increment in bmi be associate with an increase risk of diabetes
that be strong for asians and hispanic
and low for black   24    this be in contrast to our ﬁnding in gdm risk   where
the or for high bmis be high
among african americans and low
among asians because of the fact that asian
woman be at much high risk even at a
very low bmi   a recent study in new york
city find that foreign bear south asians
have a high reported prevalence of diabete at low bmi level than all other racial  
ethnic group   23    in our study   the risk of
gdm increase with bmi among all racial  
ethnic group   but the risk of gdm associate with increase bmi be low among
asian woman   who have a high risk of gdm
at low bmis   in contrast   african americans have a relatively low prevalence of
gdm even at high bmis  
the reason why asians have a high
risk of gdm at a low bmi be unclear   it
have be suggest that for a give bmi  
asians have a high percentage of body
fat and more visceral adipose tissue compare with other racial ethnic group
  21    in a study of old filipino   african
american   and white woman   aged 55 80
year    visceral adipose tissue among
normal weight filipina be signiﬁcantly high at every level of waist girth
compare with normal weight white and
african american woman   25    some of the
care diabetesjournal org
 
racial ethnic difference in gdm risk by
bmi category may be attribute to racial  
ethnic difference in body fat distribution or abdominal visceral fat at a give
bmi   the observed racial ethnic difference in the association between bmi and
gdm risk also may be attribute to difference in genetic predisposition   26    a
large study use the national health and
nutrition examination survey 1999 2004
find that among black and hispanic  
but not white subgroup   family history
be a strong risk factor for diabetes   but
this be less so among overweight or obese
subject   27    unfortunately   the national
health and nutrition examination survey
do not examine the association between
family history and diabete separately
among asians due to the small number
of asians in their study   and we be unable to examine the role of family history in
the current study  
one study of 233 woman with gdm
find that asian woman have high postchallenge glucose level than white woman
but have comparable level of fast glucose and insulin and no difference in
insulin resistance or b cell function   28   
they conclude that although asian
woman have gdm at a low bmi   the etiology seem similar   study of patient
with type 2 diabetes also have find that
asians be more likely to have abnormal
postchallenge glucose value   29 30    one
study find that two third of filipino
 
and japanese subject with diabete have
isolate postchallenge hyperglycemia
and only one third of filipino and japanese
subject would have be diagnose with
diabetes if testing criterion be limit to
fast glucose   30    in another study of
lean   healthy subject match for age  
bmi   waist circumference   birth weight  
and current diet   asians have signiﬁcantly
high postprandial glycemia and low
insulin sensitivity than white in response
to a 75 g carbohydrate load   31    a previous study find that in pregnant woman  
racial ethnic difference in glucose concentration be observe only in postchallenge
value and not in the fast state   32    if
asians have high postchallenge glucose
level than other race ethnic group   it be
possible that the current screening method
for diagnose gdm   a 50 g post challenge
test   may favor diagnosis among asians
across bmi category  
however   it also be possible that there
be underlie etiologic difference between asians and other ethnic group that
account for these difference   a study
examine the pathophysiology of impair fasting glucose versus igt   2 h
after a 75 g glucose load   find that patient with igt but normal fasting have
reduce second phase insulin release and
peripheral insulin resistance   suggest
that there may be preferential insulin
resistance in the muscle in igt   33   
therefore   it be possible that the increase

key insight
fetal macrosomia be a term use to define newborn who be significantly large than average   birth weight   4 000 g    between
15 and 45   of newborn of mother with gestational diabetes
mellitus   gdm   be macrosomic   in comparison to 12   of newborn of normal mother    macrosomic infant of woman with
gdm have a high risk of become overweight or obese at a
young age and be more likely to develop type ii diabete later
in life   the finding from several study suggest that epigenetic
alteration in different fetal gene could result in the transmission of gdm and type ii diabete from mother to their offspring  
current knowledge
in mother with gdm   the high level of blood glucose pass
through the placenta into the fetal circulation   from the second
trimester onwards   the fetal pancreas respond to the hyperglycemia by secrete insulin   result in hyperinsulinemia   this
combination of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia lead to
an increase in the fat and protein store of the fetus   result
in macrosomia   many study have explore the impact of gdm
and fetal macrosomia and show the effect on maternal and
fetal health  
practical implication
for the infant   macrosomia increase the risk of shoulder dystocia   clavicle fracture and brachial plexus injury and increase the
need for admission to neonatal intensive care unit   for the mother   the risk associate with macrosomia be caesarean delivery  
postpartum hemorrhage and vaginal laceration   there be several recommendation for the management of macrosomia to
prevent maternal and fetal birth trauma   include induction of
labor and elective caesarean section   strict regulation of maternal
blood glucose level can limit perinatal adverse outcome   newborn of gdm mother should undergo full physical examination
include evaluation for congenital anomaly   hypoglycemia  
polycythemia   hyperbilirubinemia and electrolyte abnormality

a 3 fold high rate when compare to normoglycemic
control   macrosomia be typically define as a birth weight
above the 90th percentile for gestational age or   4 000 g  
unlike maternal hyperglycemia   maternal obesity have
a strong and independent effect on fetal macrosomia   1   
gestational age at delivery   maternal pre pregnancy body
mass index   bmi    pregnancy weight gain   maternal
height   hypertension and cigarette smoking also have a
significant impact   when obese woman be compare
to normal weight woman   the newborn of obese woman
have more than double the risk of macrosomia compare
to those of woman with normal weight   2   
 
datum from the diabetes in early pregnancy study indicate that fetal birth weight correlate well with secondand third trimester postprandial blood sugar level and
not with fast or mean glucose level   3    when postprandial glucose value average 120 mg dl or less   approximately 20   of infant can be expect to be macrosomic  
and if the glucose value be as high as 160 mg dl   the rate
of macrosomia can reach up to 35   
macrosomic fetus in diabetic pregnancy develop a
unique pattern of overgrowth   involve the central deposition of subcutaneous fat in the abdominal and interscapular area   4    they have large shoulder and extremity circumference   a decrease head to shoulder ratio  
significantly high body fat and thick upper extremity
skinfold   because fetal head size be not increase   but
shoulder and abdominal girth can be markedly augment   the risk of erb s palsy   shoulder dystocia and brachial
plexus trauma be more common   however   skeletal
growth be largely unaffected  
datum from the australian carbohydrate intolerance
study in pregnant woman   achois   demonstrate a
positive relationship between the severity of maternal
fast hyperglycemia and the risk of shoulder dystocia  
with a 1 mmol increase in fast glucose lead to a 2 09
relative risk for shoulder dystocia   5   
macrosomia be associate with excessive rate of neonatal morbidity   macrosomic neonate have 5 fold high rate of severe hypoglycemia and a double increase in
neonatal jaundice in comparison with the infant of
mother without diabetes   6   
gestational diabetes mellitus and
macrosomia
 
pathophysiology of gdm
the exact mechanism behind gdm still remain unclear   the follow maternal and fetal placental factor
be interrelated and act in an integrate manner in the
development of insulin resistance and gdm  
the role of the fetal placental unit in the
development of gdm
during pregnancy   as gestational age progress   the
size of the placenta increase   there be a rise in the level
of pregnancy associate hormone like estrogen   progesterone   cortisol and placental lactogen in the maternal circulation   8   9   accompany by an increase insulin resistance   this usually begin between 20 and 24 week of
gestation   as the mother go through parturition and
deliver the fetus   the placental hormone production
stop   and so do the illness of gdm   which strongly suggest that these hormone cause gdm   10   
human placental lactogen raise approximately 10fold in the second half of the pregnancy   it stimulate lipolysis   which lead to an increase in free fatty acid in
order to provide a different fuel to the mother and to conserve glucose and amino acid for the fetus   in turn   the
increase in free fatty acid level directly interfere with the
insulin direct entry of glucose into cell   therefore   human placental lactogen be consider as a potent antagonist of insulin action during pregnancy  
the role of adipose tissue in the development of
gdm
adipose tissue produce adipocytokine   include
leptin   adiponectin   tumor necrosis factor α   tnf α   and
interleukin 6   as well as the newly discover resistin   visfatin and apelin   11   12    the role of adipocytokine and
elevate lipid concentration in pregnancy have also be
associate with the change in insulin sensitivity in nonpregnant woman   13   as well as in pregnant woman   14   
evidence suggest that one or more of these adipokine
might impair insulin signal and cause insulin resistance   12    specifically   tnf α have a potential role in decrease insulin sensitivity   15

in addition   there appear to be a role for excessive fetal insulin level in cause accelerated fetal growth   in a

there be also a high chance of uterine atony   the uterus muscle may not properly contract   result in heavy

mother have have a previous cesarean section   there be a
high chance of uterus tear along the scar line of the previous surgery

modify pedersen s hypothesis
the pathophysiology of macrosomia can be explain
base on pedersen s hypothesis of maternal hyperglycemia lead to fetal hyperinsulinemia and increase utilization of glucose and   hence   increase fetal adipose tissue   when maternal glycemic control be impair and the
maternal serum glucose level be high   the glucose crosse
the placenta   however   the maternal derive or exogenously administer insulin do not cross the placenta  
as a result   in the second trimester   the fetal pancrea  
which be now capable of secrete insulin   start to respond
to hyperglycemia and secrete insulin in an autonomous
fashion regardless of glucose stimulation   this combination of hyperinsulinemia   insulin be a major anabolic
hormone   and hyperglycemia   glucose be a major anabolic fuel   lead to an increase in the fat and protein store
of the fetus   result in macrosomia   fig   1   
 
macrosomia relate complication
maternal complication
if the baby be atypically large   vaginal birth will be more
complicate   there be a risk of prolong labor in which
the fetus might be stick in the birth canal   instrumental
delivery   with forceps or vacuum   may be need   and
even unplanned or emergency cesarean section may be
necessary   during birth   there be a great risk of laceration and tear of the vaginal tissue than when the baby be
of normal size   and the muscle between the vagina and the
anus might tear   perineal tear

fetal complication
immediate complication
premature birth   due to early induction of labor before
39 week of gestation and or premature rupture of membrane   there be a risk of preterm delivery   although all the
necessary precaution be undertake prior to induction
of early labor   newborn be still under the risk of complication associate with prematurity   include difficulty
in respiration and feed   infection   jaundice   neonatal
intensive care unit admission and perinatal death  
shoulder dystocia and erb s palsy   one of the most serious complication of vaginal delivery in macrosomic
baby be shoulder dystocia which be associate with birth
trauma   newborn with a birth weight of 4 500 g or more
carry a 6 time high risk of birth trauma   17    and the
risk of brachial plexus injury be approximately 20 time
high when the birth weight be above 4 500 g   18   
hypoglycemia at birth   one of the most common metabolic disorder of the neonate of a gdm mother be hypoglycemia   it occur due to the hyperinsulinemia of the
fetus in response to the maternal hyperglycemia in utero  
hypoglycemia can lead to more serious complication
like severe central nervous system and cardiopulmonary
disturbance   major long term sequelae include neurologic damage result in mental retardation   recurrent
seizure activity   developmental delay and personality disorder  
neonatal jaundice   factor which may account for
jaundice be prematurity   impair hepatic conjugation
of bilirubin and increase enterohepatic circulation of
bilirubin result from poor feeding   in macrosomia   neonate have a high oxygen demand cause increase
erythropoiesis and   ultimately   polycythemia   therefore  
when these cell break down   bilirubin   a byproduct of
red blood cell   increase result in neonatal jaundice  
congenital anomaly   heart defect and neural tube
defect   such as spina bifida   be the most common type
of birth defect   the high blood sugar level of woman with
gdm can damage the develop organ of the fetus  
lead to congenital anomaly

transgenerational transmission of gdm and
epigenetic
in gdm   the abnormal metabolic intrauterine environment affect the development of the fetus by induce
change in gene expression by epigenetic mechanism of
susceptible cell   lead to the development of diabete in
adulthood   offspring   f1 generation   of severely and mildly hyperglycemic mother develop gdm and other metabolic disorder in later life   affect the second generation
  f2 generation   as well   thus   gdm give rise to a vicious
cycle in which mother with gdm have baby with epigenetic change who be prone to develop metabolic disease later in life   which will give rise to a new generation of
mother with gdm   this trend of pass a disease from
one generation to another through epigenetic change be
know as transgenerational transmission   fig   2   
it be now widely accept that an adverse preconceptional and intrauterine environment be associate with
epigenetic malprogramming of the fetal metabolism and
predisposition to chronic   and in particular   metabolic
disorder later in life   22   23   
 
vation that early adverse condition be associate with
diabete and metabolic dysfunction later in life  
although the mechanism involve in the epigenetic
modification that lead to the possibility of transgenerational transmission be still unclear   evidence suggest
that methylation in germ cell might be responsible   27   
other suggest that the hyperglycemic uterine environment during pregnancy affect multiple loci in the fetal
epigenome initiate metabolic programming   lead
not only to transgenerational transmission of gdm but
also of several other metabolic disease   28   29   
in one study   30    in both f1 and f2 offspring of gdm
mother in a rat model   the expression of imprint gene
igf2 and h19 be downregulate in pancreatic islet  
which be cause by the abnormal methylation status of
the differentially methylated region   which may be one of
the mechanism for impair islet ultrastructure and
function   furthermore   in the same study   alter igf2
and h19 gene expression be find in sperm of adult f1
gdm offspring   indicate that change of epigenetic in

later complication
childhood obesity and metabolic syndrome   many
study suggest that one of the reason of childhood obesity be gdm   there have be evidence of fetal programming of later adiposity amongst offspring expose to exist diabete in utero   the offspring of pima indian
woman with preexist type ii diabete and gdm be
large for gestational age at birth and   after approximately
5 year of age   be heavy than the offspring of prediabetic or nondiabetic woman   19    the explore perinatal
outcome among child   epoch   study find that
exposure to maternal gdm be associate with a high
bmi   a great waist circumference   more visceral and
subcutaneous adipose tissue and a more centralized fat
distribution pattern in 6   to 13 year old multiethnic youth
  20    moreover   youth expose to maternal gdm in utero
have an overall high average bmi growth from 27 month
through 13 year of age and a high bmi growth velocity
start at age 10 13 year   21    these finding suggest
that the long term effect of in utero gdm exposure be
not always evident in early childhood   but rather emerge
during puberty   another sensitive period for the development of obesity   offspring of diabetic mother be also susceptible to the onset of metabolic syndrome such as increase blood pressure   hyperglycemia   obesity and abnormal cholesterol level that occur together and increase
the risk of heart disease   stroke and diabetes

crease blood mest methylation be also observe in

mest may contribute to obesity predisposition throughout life  
several study on different gene be carry out in
order to understand the epigenetic mechanism of gdm
and transgenerational transformation   all of these study
find epigenetic alteration in the respective gene which
have be study   28   31 34    therefore   from these study   we can conclude that epigenetic mechanism predispose offspring to develop type ii diabetes   gdm and
other metabolic disease in later stage of life   an increase need for insulin by the fetus to deal with high level of glucose cause by gdm be an environmental circumstance which probably trigger epigenetic change in
the early stage of life   involve gene critical to pancreatic development and b cell function   peripheral glucose
uptake and insulin resistance  
 
maternal obesity   gdm and macrosomia
the majority of mother with gdm be obese   and a
significant proportion of those who be obese have gdm
  35    one meta analysis show that the risk of develop gdm be 2 14 fold high in overweight pregnant
woman   3 56 fold high in obese pregnant woman and
8 56 fold high in severely obese pregnant woman compare to pregnant woman with normal weight   36    an

management of macrosomia
there be various recommendation for the management of macrosomia vary from expectant management and elective induction of labor before term to elective cesarean section for an estimate fetal weight of
  4 250 g   40   or   4 500 g   41   depend on the study  
study have show that the chance of vaginal delivery
be high when spontaneous labor occur than when labor
be induct   42    however   wait for spontaneous labor
to begin be an option limit by gestational age   as the
gestational age exceed 41 week of gestation   maternal
morbidity and perinatal morbidity and mortality increase   hence   timely action to induct delivery be need  
early induction of labor
give that after 37 week of gestation the fetus continue to grow at a rate of 230 g week   43    elective induction
of labor before or near term have be propose to prevent
macrosomia and its complication   44    however   there
be two factor necessary for the induction of labor   the
first be fetal lung maturation   fetuse with a diabetic

fig   2   vicious cycle of transgenerational transmission of gdm  
 
come   study   37   show that the prevalence of macrosomia among 17 244 nonobese woman without gdm
be 6 7   compare to 10 2   in 2 791 nonobese woman
with gdm and 20 2   in 935 obese woman with gdm  
a study have show that maternal obesity be a strong
predictor of a large for gestational age infant than maternal hyperglycemia   38    in the hapo study   37    the
investigator find that the frequency of macrosomia in
gdm be increase by 50   compare to non gdm in
both the nonobese and obese group   obesity be associate with a 2 fold high frequency of macrosomia whether in the non gdm or gdm group   macrosomia in gdm
only be present in 26    in gdm plus obesity in 33   and
in obesity only in 41    a large prospective study from
spain find that the upper quartile of maternal bmi be
responsible for 23   of macrosomia   while gdm account for 3 8    39    woman who do not have gdm but who
be obese have a 13 6   increase risk of macrosomia   define as a child weigh 4 000 g or more at birth   than
nonobese woman   37   
from this   we can conclude that although gdm and
maternal obesity be independently associate with adverse pregnancy outcome   the combination of both
gdm and maternal obesity have a great effect on macrosomia  
 
 
in some study   elective induction of
labor for macrosomia be find to
increase the rate of cesarean delivery
without improvement in perinatal
outcome  
elective cesarean section
many study suggest offer a cesarean section to patient who be suspect of expect a macrosomic infant   especially to those with gdm   insulin dependent
diabete and a previous high birth weight infant   so as to
 
prevent maternal and fetal birth trauma   unfortunately  
measure to calculate the weight of the fetus be inaccurate   48    in one study   it be claim that   in a general
population   it be unreasonable to perform an elective cesarean section to prevent brachial plexopathy   49   
management of the neonate
large for gestational age neonate do not only include postterm infant   but also term or even preterm infant   this should be keep in mind as the management
and the main concern in treatment could differ   a strictly regulate maternal blood sugar level decrease the perinatal adverse outcome  
neonate with a diabetic mother should undergo a full
physical examination from head to toe   congenital anomaly   congenital heart defect   tracheoesophageal fistula
and central nervous system abnormality   and birth
trauma be of more concern   they should receive intensive observation and care and should be evaluate for
hypoglycemia   polycythemia   hyperbilirubinemia and
electrolyte abnormality  
the blood glucose level should be examine within 1
h of life   then every hour for the next 6 8 h and then as
need   oral feeding   ideally breast feeding   be recommend as soon as possible   and if oral feeding be insufficient   an intravenous infusion of glucose should be

introduction
the 2003 revision of the u s   standard certificate of live birth
include information on two type of diabetes   define as glucose
intolerance require treatment    prepregnancy   diagnosis
of diabetes before pregnancy   and gestational   diagnosis of
diabete during pregnancy    1 3    differentiate between the
two type of diabetes be important because   although both be
establish risk factor for several adverse maternal and infant
health outcome   the condition occur at different frequency
and have different impact on pregnancy outcome   4 9    the
focus of this report be on gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   
which be specific to pregnancy and occur more frequently than
prepregnancy diabete   10 12   
gdm be a common complication in pregnancy   8 13   
affect about 2   10   of pregnancy in the united states
annually   10 11 14    the presence of gdm can lead to negative
health outcome for both mother and infant   adverse health
outcome for the mother include an increase risk of develop
cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabete later in life   gdm
in subsequent pregnancy   maternal hypertensive disorder  
and have a cesarean delivery   5 8 10 15 19    adverse health
outcome for the infant include an increase risk of preterm birth
and macrosomia   and the development of type 2 diabete later in
life   5 8 17 19    study have find increase gdm rate over
time in both the united states and internationally   9 12 20 24   
and a large increase in gdm during the covid 19 pandemic
compare with prepandemic time   25 27   
national information on gdm become available for the first
time in 2016   this report present overall trend in gdm among
woman give birth in the united states from 2016 through
2020 and rate of gdm by maternal race and hispanic origin  
age   body mass index   bmi    state of residence   and plurality for
2016   2019   and 2020  
 
method
this analysis use datum from the birth certificate and be
base on 100   of birth register in the united states for 2016
through 2020   trend analysis be perform use 2016 2020
datum and a more detailed analysis be conduct on 2020 datum  
comparison be make between 2016 and 2019   2019 and
2020   and 2016 and 2020 for the overall gdm rate and all other
characteristic   these time period be select to examine the
full time period for which final national gdm datum be currently
available   2016 2020   and to examine change in gdm before
  2016 2019   and during   2020   the covid 19 pandemic  
the gdm item be add to the birth certificate with the
2003 revision and be report by all state as of 2016   birth
certificate datum on gdm be recommend to be collect from
the mother s medical record   1    mother be to be report
as have gdm if there be a diagnosis of glucose intolerance
require treatment during this pregnancy in her medical record
  2    of the 3 613 647 birth register in the united states for
2020   4 063   or 0 1    be miss gdm information   datum
on bmi be miss for 1 9    70 408   of birth and datum on

0 01     and plurality   95 or 0 003    be impute   record
miss information on gdm   bmi   and hispanic origin be
exclude from analysis  
race and hispanic origin be report separately on the
birth certificate and be self report by the mother   all race and
hispanic origin group be base on single race reporting and
be consistent with the 1997 office of management and budget
standard   28    maternal race and hispanic origin category

plurality be define as the number of fetus deliver live or
dead at any time in the pregnancy regardless of gestational age  
or if the fetus be deliver at different date in the pregnancy
 
 
national vital statistic report   vol   71   no   3   july 19   2022
 
  2    plurality be classify as singleton   twin   and triplet and
high order birth  
gdm rate be express as the number of live birth to
woman with gdm per 100 live birth   all statement about
difference in rate in the text have be test for statistical
significance   and statement that a give rate be high or low
than another rate indicate that the rate be significantly different
use a two tail z test at the alpha level of 0 05   31   
reference to decrease or increase trend in rate
  for example   trend in rate for 2016 2020   be statistically
significant at the 0 05 level and be assess use the cochranarmitage test for trend   a modify chi squared test  
comparison between state rate and the u s   rate account
for the individual state s contribution to the u s   rate   therefore  
each state rate be compare with a unique u s   rate   independent
of the state s contribution to the total u s   rate  
the reliability of percentage be evaluate base on
standard develop by nch   for detailed information on
the standard   see   national center for health statistic datum

these finding be generally consistent with the finding of
other study   though some disagreement exist in the literature
as to whether rate be low for non hispanic black or nonhispanic white woman   5 10 17 33 42    recent study have
also observe large increase in gdm during the covid 19
pandemic compare with prepandemic time   25 27    the
large than average increase in gdm during 2019 2020 may be
relate   in part   to change observe in the general and at risk
population   include pregnant woman    such as decrease
physical activity   weight gain   and other lifestyle factor that be
know to impact gdm   43 48   
 
limitation
underreporte of health condition be consider a primary
limitation of birth certificate datum   49 50    two study that
examine datum from the 2003 birth certificate revision for three
vital statistic reporting area find low level of sensitivity   a
measure of underreporte   for gdm across all three reporting
area   range from 57 7   to 59 6    51 52    however   the
kappa score   a more conservative measure of agreement   be
find to be moderate to substantial   range from 0 55 to 0 68
  51 52   
 
conclusion
gdm be a common complication in pregnancy that can lead
to negative health outcome for both mother and infant   a
primary advantage of birth certificate datum be that information be
collect on all woman give birth in the united states each
year   allow for analysis of both national trend and trend for
small population group   such as native hawaiian and other
pacific islander subgroup   despite concern with potential
report issue   trend and pattern in the gdm rate show in
this report be generally consistent with those of other study
and these datum provide opportunity to examine gdm among a
large population of woman give birth in the united states

conclusion
risk of diabetes and agt
the study and control group be reasonably representative of the original
population   woman with gdm with follow up differ from those without follow up in the rate of macrosomia and
insulin therapy   which   in turn   have not
be find to be predictive of agt or
diabete    and control woman undergo follow up be slightly shift toward
  less normal   glucose tolerance   high
glycemic response to glucose screen
during index pregnancy    we interpret
these finding as indicate that woman
with prior gdm who receive insulin
be probably more concerned about
their risk of diabetes   but we have no explanation for the negative association
with macrosomia   as to the reason underlie the high glycemic response to
gdm screen in participate control
woman   we speculate that this could have
be attributable to a high rate of diabetic background in the family  
as expect   the cumulative incidence of diabetes and agt in the woman
with previous gdm be high than in
control subject   13 8 vs   0   and 42 4 vs  
2 8    respectively   11 year after the incident pregnancy    in woman of the same
geographic area   age 25   44 year   the
prevalence of diabetes and igt have be
report to be 1 7 and 8 3    respectively
  20    figure in the range of the cumulative incidence of agt describe here for
the control group   nevertheless   the progression rate of woman with gdm to diabetes be low than previously
report   2 5 8 9    but the risk of agt
be in the high range   because both igt
diabetes care   volume 26   number 4   april 2003
 
and ifg imply a risk of future diabete
  18    we hypothesize that   with long follow up   the cumulative incidence of diabete in these woman might approach the
rate see in the literature   give that the
control group initiate follow up 5 year
after delivery   this might have shift the
survival curve to the right   spuriously increase the difference between they and
woman with prior gdm   nevertheless   a
bias be impossible for the cumulative incidence of diabetes   0   in the control
group   and probably minimal for agt
  2 8   in the control group   
in explanation for the difference between our study and other study   it
should be note that we have a more comprehensive screening policy in our center  
in addition to the usual screening at
24   28 week   additional test be perform at the first visit and at 31 34 week  
patient diagnose after a positive screening in the third period can be assume to
have a more subtle glucose metabolism
derangement than those diagnose early  
this would mirror the situation describe
by o sullivan and mahan   21    with the
risk of progression to diabetes increase
as the criterion for gdm diagnosis become
strict   ethnicity could be another reason   as most of our patient be caucasian and the risk of diabetes be low in
these subject   22    finally   we speculate
that tight target of bg control during
pregnancy   16   could have help to preserve    cell function   23   
type of diabetes
as to the type of diabetes   these woman  
when become diabetic   essentially develop type 2 diabetes   the cumulative
incidence of type 1 diabete at 11 year
be 0 7    whereas publish study in
caucasian woman with gdm have report figure of 1 7   6 6   in follow up
period of 2 11 year   8 11 13    this difference could be attribute to the fact
that   with one exception   11    these other
study be perform in northern europe   where the risk of type 1 diabetes be
high than in spain   24   
predictor of diabetes and agt
as expect   in accordance with previous
report   2 4 5 9    high prepregnancy bmi
  surrogate of insulin resistance    severity
of gdm   high bg value and early diagnosis    and previous hyperglycemia   both
surrogate of inadequate    cell function
for the prevail insulin resistance   be
 
independent predictor of agt and diabete at follow up   it be important to note
that the risk attribute to all quantitative
predictor be nonlinear   a fact that have
be describe   only for some variable  
in woman with prior gdm   10   and in the
general population   25    moreover   it be
important to note that prepregnancy bmi
be a predictive factor of glucose tolerance
at 26 4 kg m2   slightly overweight range  
in the case of diabetes and 24 kg m2   normal weight range   in the case of agt   surprisingly   insulin therapy and bmi at
follow up be not among the predictor  
probably because they be represent
by other variable   severity of gdm for
insulin therapy   and prepregnancy bmi
for bmi at follow up    furthermore   additional pregnancy do not increase the
risk of future diabete   a fact that contrast
with the result of peters et al    26    who
report that a single pregnancy more
than triple the risk of type 2 diabete in
hispanic woman with previous gdm  
this could be because of the high risk of
diabete in the aforementioned study  
mean that the additional risk of subsequent pregnancy would become more
evident   the fact that the summary of the
fourth workshop conference on gestational diabetes acknowledge that the influence of parity on the risk of diabetes be
controversial and may vary among ethnic
group   27   highlight the importance of
this negative finding  
even more surprising in our study
be the fact that autoantibody positivity
be not a predictor of type 1 diabetes  
most study finding concur with this
point   8 11 13    in 1996   our group publish finding indicate that woman
with gdm who test positive for ica
have a high prevalence of agt early after
delivery   28    at that time   our feeling be
that these woman would progress to diabetes   either typical type 1 or latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult   lada    
however   with long follow up   the progression to diabetes and agt of the antibody negative cohort have become more
pronounce   thus diminish the difference present shortly after delivery  
in relation to the prediction of future
diabetes and agt   some information
about afe and afp of diabetes predictor
have be report for the general population   29    but be lack for woman with
gdm   we would like to remark on its
importance   especially on that of afp  
which indicate the percentage of risk in

summary
complex though integrate hormonal and metabolic change characterize
pregnancy   in the face of progressive decline in insulin action   glucose
homeostasis be maintain through a compensatory increase in insulin
secretion   this switch energy production from carbohydrate to lipid  
make glucose readily available to the fetus   this precise and entangle
hormonal and metabolic condition can   however   be disrupt and diabetic
hyperglycemia can develop   gestational diabetes    the increase in plasma
glucose level be believe to confer significant risk of complication to both the
mother and the fetus and the newborn   moreover   exposition of fetal tissue
to the diabetic maternal environment can translate into an increase risk for
development of diabetes and or the metabolic syndrome in the adult life  
in woman with previous gestational diabetes   the risk of develop type 2
diabetes be greatly enhance   to the point that gdm represent an early stage
in the natural history of type 2 diabetes   in these woman   accurate follow up
and prevention strategy be need to reduce the subsequent development of
overt diabete   this paper will review current knowledge on the modification
occur in normal pregnancy   while outline the mechanism   in this
paper   we will review the change of intermediary metabolism occur
during pregnancy   in particular   we will outline the mechanism responsible
for gestational diabetes   the link between these alteration and associate

pregnancy be characterize by a complex endocrine metabolic adaptation
process include impair insulin sensitivity   increase β cell response  
moderate increase in blood glucose level particularly follow the ingestion
of a meal   and change in the level of circulate free fatty acid  
triglyceride   cholesterol   and phospholipid   these change do not reflect
a pathological condition   rather   they represent a necessary   possibly
indispensable   adaptation to meet the energy demand of the fetus and to
prepare the maternal organism for delivery and lactation  
typically   a condition of insulin resistance develop in the second and
third trimester of pregnancy   the impairment of insulin sensitivity   however  
make pregnancy a diabetogenic condition   nonetheless   only 3 to 5   of
woman develop gestational diabetes   1 2    predisposing factor must play a
role   so that glucose homeostasis be usually restore soon after the delivery be
complete   however   the development of gestational diabetes represent a

progress   a condition of insulin resistance set in   the
impairment of insulin action be more pronounce at
the level of skeletal muscle than adipose tissue   5    the
reduction of insulin sensitivity be a common event and be
independent of the initial condition   catalano et al    6 7   
use the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp   estimate
a 47   reduction in insulin sensitivity in obese woman and
a 56   reduction in normal weight woman in the third
trimester of gestation   accord to other study   with
the progression of pregnancy   insulin sensitivity can be
reduce as much as 60 to 80    8    the insulin resistance
develop in pregnancy be likely to be a physiological
event favor glucose supply to the fetus   the reduce
insulin mediate utilization of glucose switch the
maternal energy metabolism from carbohydrate to lipid
substrate   free fatty acid    redirect carbohydrate
toward the fetal tissue   9    even the slight   though

impair insulin sensitivity can contribute to reroute
nutrient from the mother to the fetus   10 12    the
 
development of gestational diabetes be associate with
a much great severity of insulin resistance   in these
woman   a low insulin sensitivity be likely to be
present both before and after pregnancy   in our own

the insulin resistance that develop during pregnancy
be similar to that observe in type 2 diabetes   with
impair insulin action mainly due to postreceptor
alteration involve glucose transport and intracellular
metabolism in insulin sensitive tissue   the degree of
insulin resistance seem to be influence by obesity
and inheritance   in fact   in obese woman   bmi    30
or weight    150   of ideal body weight   the incidence
of gdm be 1 4   to 20 fold high than that in normalweight subject   13    high rate of gdm have be
show in ethnic group who be also more susceptible to
a high incidence of type 2 diabetes   but a substantial
proportion of woman with previous gdm have neither
parent affect with igt or type 2 diabetes   14    this
suggest that the inheritance of gdm be characterize
by a polygenic inheritance or environmental influence
rather than autosomal dominant inheritance with a high
penetrance  
the study of the insulin binding have not demonstrate
significant modification either in normal pregnancy or
in gdm   15 17    although a reduce activity   30 40

hormone associate with
modification in insulin secretion
and action
though the specific mechanism s   of the alteration of
insulin secretion and action remain uncertain   a substantial contribution be make by endocrine modification
that accompany pregnancy   table 1    change in β cell
function occur in parallel with the development of the
feto placental unit and the local production of hormone  
such as estrogen   progesterone   cortisol   human chorionic
somatotropin   hcs   or placental lactogen   hpl    prl   and
gh   these hormone have be show to induce insulin
resistance both in vitro and in vivo  
estrogen and progesterone increase during the early
phase of pregnancy and be involve in maternal glycometabolic modification   estrogen increase insulin concentration and insulin bind   43    while progesterone
cause glucose intolerance by decrease insulin bind
and glucose transport   and by impair insulin suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis   44   
plasma concentration of cortisol approximately double
during pregnancy   an excess of glucocorticoid can induce
insulin resistance at a postreceptor level by impair
insulin receptor phosphorylation and by reduce the cell
content of irs 1   45   
the hormone placental lactogen   hpl   be the product of
the hpl a and hpl b gene   it be secrete into the maternal
and fetal circulation after the sixth week of pregnancy  
hpl promote maternal production of insulin like growth
factor   igfs    modulate intermediary metabolism   and
contribute to direct energy substrate toward the
fetus   46 47    in concert with estradiol   progesterone  
and prolactin   it stimulate maternal behavior   48   
similar to the growth hormone   hpl contribute to
the reduction of insulin sensitivity   44    hpl have be
suggest to play a role in the control of embryonic
growth   49    finally   lactogen hormone   hpl   hgh  
prl   have be implicate in the regulation of islet
mass increase that occur during normal pregnancy   50   
owe to these property   hpl be consider as a potential
therapeutic agent for survival of transplanted pancreatic
islet   42   
leptin be the protein codify by the obese   ob   gene
consist of 167 amino acid   51    it be secrete by
 
the adipose tissue and act at the hypothalamic level
through the inhibition of neuropeptide y and by stimulate thermogenesis   52    plasma leptin level increase
significantly during pregnancy reach a peak in the
second trimester   at 36 week   gestation   it be 1 7 fold
high than it be postpartum   53    it have be suggest that pregnancy may represent a leptin resistant
state   54 55    since elevated concentration of leptin
may sound paradoxical in the face of increase food
intake   circulate plasma leptin level correlate with
plasma insulin concentration as well as with maternal
adipose mass   as such   it can be consider a marker
of insulin resistance and obesity   56    the impact of
glucose homeostasis during pregnancy on plasma leptin
be not completely clear   recent datum show that woman
with gestational diabete have increase plasma leptin concentration during and after pregnancy   57 59   
moreover   leptin concentration be positively relate to
hba1c and the newborn s body weight   suggest that
poor glycemic control may favor adipose tissue accumulation in the newborn from woman with gdm   cord
leptin concentration correlate with the fetus s weight
at birth as well as with other fetal anthropometric
indice   60    thus   leptin be likely to play a role in
fetal growth and can interfere with maternal glucose
metabolism  
plasma glucagon concentration increase during the
last trimester of pregnancy   a slight increase may
contribute to insulin resistance   61    plasma glucagon
level be even high in woman with gdm   62    it be not
clear whether elevate glucagon level have any role in
the pathogenensis of gdm or if they simply reflect the
relative insulin deficiency of these woman  
 
glucose metabolism
fast plasma glucose remain constant till the third
month of pregnancy   thereafter   plasma glucose tend
to decrease by 10 to 15 mg dl in the presence of a
twofold increase in plasma insulin concentration   concomitantly   endogenous glucose production   egp   be
enhance by 16 to 30    4   in order to meet the increase
energy requirement   the increase in endogenous production of glucose be almost completely account

for by gluconeogenesis   similarly to what happen in
type 2 diabetes   increase availability of circulate
free fatty acid   ffa   may contribute to support gluconeogenesis   however   while in type 2 diabetes   high plasma ffa level may reduce glucose
oxidation   63    during the physiological pregnancy  
the latter be not reduce   rather it be high   64   
this suggest that active gluconeogenesis during pregnancy be likely to be the direct consequence of
the hormonal profile   rather than change in the
metabolic milieu  
while basal plasma glucose level tend to decrease
with the progression of pregnancy   plasma glucose
excursion after meal ingestion be large and last
long as a consequence of impaired insulin mediate
glucose utilization   egp suppression   and inadequate
increase in first phase insulin secretion   table 2    the
exacerbation of these mechanism also lead to gdm  
in these woman   basal egp increase to a similar
extent both in patient with gdm and in control
woman throughout gestation   late in pregnancy   insulin
suppression of egp be less effective in patient with
gdm than in control subject   27    possibly due to a
more severe resistance of the liver to the suppressive
effect of insulin   thus   postprandial hyperglycemia   and
post ogtt hyperglycemia   be the more common initial
alteration of glucose homeostasis in gdm   the loss of early
insulin release in these woman be likely to contribute to the
loss of glucose tolerance and postprandial hyperglycemia  
the physiological relevance of first phase insulin secretion
have be recently emphasize   65    the loss of first phase
insulin release have to be see as a marker for deterioration
of the β cell function   as defect in insulin secretion have
be report by a number of investigator   66 70

gestational diabete
in normal pregnancy   glucose homeostasis be maintain   in spite of insulin resistance   by a concomitant
compensatory increase in insulin secretion   the increase
in insulin secretion be associate with hypertrophy and
hyperplasia of the β cell   35    it be very likely that these
change be trigger and maintain by placental hormone   inadequate β cell adaptation be likely to contribute
to the development of gestational diabetes   inability to
compensate for insulin resistance may reflect intrinsic
alteration of the β cell   as in the case of glucokinase
mutation   5   of all case of gdm    72    or extrinsic
mechanism   as in the case of an autoimmune process
   10     73    however   the vast majority of the case do
not recognize an identifiable cellular alteration   both in
gdm and type 2 diabetes   intolerance to carbohydrate
develop as soon as β cell secretion be no long sufficient
to compensate for insulin resistance   74    for this reason   accord to some author   gdm represent an early
stage in the natural history of type 2 diabetes   75    the
transition time from gdm to overt type 2 diabetes can
be shorten as a function of the number of pregnancy  
accord to peters et al    76    a second pregnancy be associate with a threefold increase in the risk of develop
type 2 diabetes in woman with a positive history for gdm  
suggest that recurrence of insulin resistance state can
accelerate the decline of β cell function   in woman with
previous gdm   the rate of conversion to type 2 diabetes
can be as high as 2 to 3   per year  
several factor be know to contribute to evolution
toward overt type 2 diabetes   this   indeed   be more
frequent in woman in whom   1   gdm be diagnose before
the 24th week of pregnancy   risk at 5 year of 80

besides the abnormality in glucose homeostasis  
woman with prior gdm also carry a great risk
for hypertension   hyperlipidemia   electrocardiographic
alteration   and mortality   78    in 1996   meyersseifer and vohr   79   report that total cholesterol  
triglyceride   ldl cholesterol   glucose   and systolic blood
pressure be all significantly high among gdm woman  
suggest a condition similar to the metabolic syndrome
occur in these woman   thus   not only be gdm a main
predispose condition to type 2 diabetes but also it may
identify woman who will develop at a great rate the full
metabolic syndrome   80   
woman with previous gdm should therefore be
enrol in follow up program design to ensure
continuous surveillance and   possibly   provide effective
primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and metabolic
syndrome   the latter should include correct diet   bodyweight control   and regular physical activity   less

during pregnancy   the metabolic change occur at
the level of the liver and adipose tissue have quite an
impact on triacylglycerol   fatty acid   cholesterol   and
phospholipid   follow an initial reduction during the
first eight week of pregnancy   plasma level of lipid tend
to increase

of steroid hormone   while fatty acid be oxidize and
use for cellular membrane synthesis   the change in the
concentration of total cholesterol reflect modification in
various lipoprotein fraction   hdl cholesterol increase
from the 12th week in response to the estrogen

period   total and ldl cholesterol progressively increase
with the beginning of the second trimester   a similar
behavior occur for plasma level of very high density
lipoprotein   vldl   and triacylglycerol   the latter be
increase not only in vldl lipoprotein but also in lowdensity lipoprotein   ldl   and high density lipoprotein
  hdl    these change be more likely account for
by an increase in synthesis as well as a reduction in
triacylglycerol clearance   the enhance synthesis occur
at the level of the liver under the effect of high estrogen
level   83 84    while a low activity of lipoprotein lipase
  lpl   and hepatic lipase   hl    85 86   lead to impaired
removal from the circulate compartment   it be very
likely that the concomitant reduction of insulin sensitivity
may also contribute to the increase in triglyceride
concentration  
abundance of vldl triacylglycerol be associate with
accelerate transfer of triglyceride toward hdl by

woman with gdm   triacylglycerol level be increase
along with low hdl cholesterol level   as compare to
normotolerant pregnant woman   circulate free fatty
acid be also increase   which can contribute to the
insulin resistant condition as well as to the development
of fetal macrosomia since they freely pass through
the placenta   93

mother s tissue   while route glucose and amino acid

metabolic change in response to fast   that be   plasma
glucose and insulin reduction   and plasma free fatty
acid and ketene increase   tend to develop much fast
in pregnant as oppose to nonpregnant woman   95   
whether this behavior be the result of concomitant insulin
resistance exert a less effective restrain on adipose
tissue lipolysis be not clear   but the rapid switch of
energy metabolism to lipid may indicate an adaptive
change favor protein preservation   nonetheless   the
rapid activation of ketogenesis in fast pregnant woman
may pose serious problem to the fetus   as ketone body
can cross the placenta freely   though they may represent
a readily available substrate for hepatic and cerebral
oxidization in the fetus   they may have a deleterious effect
on the psychoneurological development   large survey
have indicate that maternal ketonemia be associate with
a significant reduction of the intelligence quotient   iq   of
the offspring study at the age of three and five year
  96    for this reason   a strong recommendation exist to
prevent ketosis during pregnancy with the administration
of frequent meal in order to ensure adequate supply of

there be considerable evidence show that an increase
of maternal glycemia be associate with an increase risk
of fetal and neonatal morbidity   pregnancy in diabetic
woman be associate with increase risk for congenital

diabetes   more recent study   however   do not support
this increase rate of congenital malformation in
gdm   105 107    while report comparable rate of
anomaly between woman with gdm and the general
population   accord to these study   the risk of
congenital malformation be more likely associate with
pregestationl diabetes and it appear to be proportional
to the increase in glucose level during the first period of
pregnancy   108    observational study have suggest
that fast glucose level great than 120 mg dl be
associate with a two fold increase in the risk of
congenital anomaly   106   
an increase in glucose level below the diagnostic
threshold for diabete in the second half of pregnancy
be also associate with a slight but continuous increase
in the risk of macrosomia and cesarian section   109   
most of these complication be directly relate to the
exposure of fetal tissue to excessive glucose crossing
the placenta   the chronic stimulation of fetal insulin
secretion cause hypertrophy of insulin sensitive tissue

  adipose tissue   skeletal and myocardial muscle   hepatic
tissue   islet of langerhan    accelerate fetal growth and
macrosomia   and   after resection of the umbilical chord  
neonatal hypoglycemia   this condition exacerbate in the
presence of excessive   transplacental nutritive flow   of
free fatty acid and amino acid that may occur with
gdm   for instance   an excess of branched chain amino
acid supply to the fetus may favor β cell replication and
insulin hypersecretion   other growth factor such as igfs
be involve in fetal growth   the role of the igf system in
fetal as well as childhood growth be support by a wide
body of experimental and clinical evidence   110 111   
macrosomia be define as weight at birth great than
4000 g or   more correctly   as the weight at birth above the
90th percentile for gestational age   large for gestational
age   lga    112    about 70   of neonatal macrosomias
can be attribute to genetic and constitutional factor   to
prolong pregnancy   or   more rarely   to the presence
of particular syndrome such as tumor   nesidioblastosis  
and transposition of the large vessel   113    in about 30  
of case   it occur in the child of a diabetic mother  
with great frequency in obese and multiparous woman
  114    in diabetic pregnancy   macrosomia be typically
dysmorphic due to disproportionate and great growth
of the trunk   shoulder and abdomen   with respect to the
head   the child will   therefore   be subject to a high risk of
very serious obstetric complication   such as dystocia of
the shoulder  
another serious complication of maternal hyperglycemia and possible cause of endouterine death be fetal
hypertrophic myocardiopathy   this be characterize by
hypertrophy of the septum and the ventricular wall  
which can sometimes be so severe as to obstruct normal
blood flow   these abnormality can remain asymptomatic   but sometimes they be the cause of severe
cardiac failure   though   in general   they regress within
the first three to six month of life   115    fetal hyperinsulinism may contribute to the development of this
complication   116    the newborn s heart   indeed   be very
abundant in insulin receptor   make the myocardial
tissue very responsive to hypertrophic stimulus  
until about 20 year ago   the risk of respiratory
distress syndrome   rd   or hyaline membrane disease
in newborn of diabetic mother be about six fold
great than that of nondiabetic woman   nowadays   as a
consequence of well control of diabetes and reduction
of premature birth   the risk of rd be not different from
that of the general population   nonetheless   when glucose
control be poor   a delay of pulmonary maturation be likely
to occur   the excess of insulin level in the fetal circulation
be associate with low production of surfactant   high
insulin inhibit the type ii epithelial cell and pulmonary
fibroblast responsible for the synthesis and release of the
pneumocyte fibroblastic factor necessary for pulmonary
maturation and surfactant synthesis   117   
the most common complication of diabetic pregnancy
be neonatal hypoglycemia   this be the direct result of
maternal hyperglycemia cause fetal β cell hyperplasia
and hyperinsulinemia   at birth   upon the section of the

g   di cianni et al  
 
umbilical cord   the deprivation of the maternal glucose
supply easily cause hypoglycemia   for this very reason  
hypoglycemia usually develop during the first hour of
life   in the newborn   hypoglycemia can be asymptomatic
or it can be accompany by aspecific symptom such
as lethargy   agitation   and spasm of the extremity  
respiratory disorder   and epilepsy   severe complication
tend to develop more frequently in newborn from
diabetic mother with poor metabolic control and from
those receive large amount of glucose during labor or
at delivery   118   
the sudden interruption of the nutrient flow from
the mother to the fetus with rapid reduction of calcium
supply can cause hypocalcemia   can      7 mg dl   and
hypomagnesiemia   mg      1 5 mg dl    this usually
occur in the first hour of life with great frequency
in newborn from diabetic mother   a phenomenon as
frequent as 50   in these baby   the severity of such
a condition be correlate with the degree of control of
maternal diabetes   the perinatal stress   and the degree
of immaturity of the newborn   it usually develop
over the initial 12 to 24 h after birth with irritability  
neuromuscular excitability   and fascicular contraction of
the tongue   apnea   and occasionally convulsion   followup datum be   unfortunately   lack in assess the
potential harm associate with neonatal hypocalcemia
  119 120   
hyperbilirubinemia   bilirubin   13 mg dl   also occur
more frequently in newborn of a diabetic mother   20   
than in newborn from nondiabetic woman   even after
match for gestational age   10     besides the usual
pathogenetic factor   prematurity   modify hepatic conjugation   modification of the entero hepatic circulation   
in newborn from diabetic mother   an increase erythropoiesis induce by chronic hyperinsulinemia as well
as accelerate hemolysis due to glycation process have
be suggest   121   
polycythemia be diagnose for a venous hematocrit
  65   or hemoglobin   20 g dl   this condition as
well be more frequent   up to 30    in newborn of
diabetic mother and reflect a condition of relative
hypoxemia   this may be   at least in part   account for by
fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia   under these
circumstance   the shift of synthesis from fetal to adult
hemoglobin   with great affinity to oxygen   be delay  
favor chronic hypoxia   the latter can be sustain
by the metabolic adaptation of the fetus that enhance
oxygen consumption with no compensatory increase
in placental blood flow   and by poor transplacental
exchange because of villi hypertrophy and reduction
of the intervillous space   under the stimulus of acute and
chronic hypoxia   extramedullary erythropoiesis will be
activate and polycytemia will develop   122   
the risk for the infant of woman with gdm be
not limit to the perinatal period of time   rather it
extend much long   subject who have be expose
to the in utero diabetic maternal environment have

in pima indians   pettitt et al    127   report a 1 4  
rate of diabetes among offspring of nondiabetic mother
as compare to 8 65   in offspring of mother with
prediabete and 45   in offspring of diabetic mother  
similar association have be report in offspring of
woman with gestational diabetes   126    silverman   128  
demonstrate a disturbance in glucose metabolism in
23   of offspring of diabetic mother that be associate
with obesity   high fasting glucose and insulin level  
and increase insulin resistance   of interest be the
observation that 35   of the woman with gdm be
themselves offspring of diabetic mother  
 
conclusion
complex though integrate hormonal and metabolic
change occur in pregnant woman   these change
ensure maternal metabolic efficiency and adequate
distribution of nutrient to the fetus   typically   pregnancy
be associate with a physiologic reduction of insulin
sensitivity   which be accompany by a compensatory
increase in β cell mass and function   in the presence
of predispose   genetic   and environmental factor  
however   an exaggerated response can develop   capable
of condition the physiological course of pregnancy
and neonatal outcome   in particular   the development
of hyperglycemia and gestational diabetes be associate
with both short   and long term complication in the
mother as well as in the child   woman with previous
gestational diabete have a 50   increase   as compare
to the general population   in the risk of develop
type 2 diabetes   a well understanding of the cause
of gestational diabetes and ensue type 2 diabetes  
accurate follow up   and prevention strategy be need
to reduce the conversion to overt diabete in these
woman   child of diabetic mother be expose to
the risk of complication during pregnancy and in the
perinatal period   but they be also likely to experience
long term side effect   epidemiological datum indicate that
these individual have an increase incidence of the
metabolic syndrome   obesity   alter glucose tolerance  
dyslipidemia   hypertension    for child of diabetic
mother too   then   regular and accurate follow up if
not preventive and or therapeutic measure should
be foresee   unfortunately   while there be information
support the positive impact of diabetes control
during pregnancy   datum relate to long term risk be
miss   future research should be design to address
these issue  
 
 
 
 
abstract
background    glucose intolerance during pregnancy predispose the offspring for increase risk of
develop glucose intolerance in the future   this vicious cycle be likely to influence and perpetuate the
incidence and prevalence of glucose intolerance in any population  
aim    no data be available about the prevalence of glucose intolerance during pregnancy in our country
and hence a study be undertake on this aspect  
method    this study be perform in the antenatal clinic of government maternity hospital   chennai  
india   as a pregnant woman in second or third trimester check into the antenatal clinic   she be give
50 gm oral glucose load and blood sample be collect after one hour   this test be perform on
1251 pregnant woman   they be request to come after 72 hour for the 75 gm ogtt recommend
by who   among the 1251 woman   891 respond   the blood sample be take in the fast state
and at 2 hour after 75 gm of oral glucose   diagnosis be base on the who criteria for gestational
diabete mellitus   gdm   
result    the mean age of these pregnant woman be 23    4 year   there be a significant increase in
the prevalence of gdm in relation to gravida   the effect of bmi do not quite reach statistical significance
  χ2   df 1     3 659   p    0 055    but a model of linear trend be significant  
of the 1251 woman who undergo the 50 gm oral glucose challenge test   670   53 55    have one hour
plasma glucose    130 mg dl   among the 891 pregnant woman who have 75 gms ogtt   168   18 9   
be diagnose as gdm   take both fpg    126 mg dl and or 2 hr ppg    140 mg dl as cut off value  
take only 2 hr plasma glucose for analysis   144   16 2    have a value    140 mg dl  
a similar study be conduct in different part of the country take only the 2 hr 75 gm post glucose
value of    140 mg dl as diagnostic criterion for gdm   of the total number of pregnant woman   n    3674  
screen   16 55   of they find to have gdm  
conclusion    our study have document the increase prevalence of gdm in our population
necessitate universal screening for glucose intolerance in pregnancy   use 2 hr plasma glucose    140
mg dl as a one step procedure be simple and economical   particularly for the country ethnically more
prone to high prevalence of diabetes

to the need to direct special attention to this population  
especially in develop country 1 the primary prevention
be likely to reverse or halt this trend   for this the need be to
focus at the intrauterine environment as the   preventive
medicine start before birth    intrauterine exposure to
hyperglycemia during the critical period of fetal development
program the development of pancrea negatively and
affect the insulin secretory function 2 hence this study be
undertake to detect the glucose intolerance that occur
during pregnancy as this metabolic disturbance predispose

discussion
we believe that the way the study subject be
ascertain provide a representative and unbiased sample
of pregnant woman   as the bulk of the pregnant woman attend
hospital of this type for antenatal check up and confinement
in our country  
among 1251 pregnant woman screen with glucose
challenge   891 respond for 2 hr 75 gm ogtt   however  
neither positive family history nor parity influence the
report for the 75 gm 2 hr test   this phenomenon of no
show rate appear to be universal   magee et al report in
their follow up   91 of the 457 positive screen individual fail
to undergo diagnostic test 10 luiz et al also observe in their
study   that 23   of their screen positive woman do not return
for ogtt 11 our prevalence rate be 18 9    we get this figure
as we take into consideration for analysis the fpg value also
as this be available besides 2hr ppg   of the 891 woman   24
have fpg    126 mg dl   they might have have pregestational
diabete   we could not confirm this as a1c estimation be not

also do not perform the test 12 if our estimate prevalence
proportion among those positive and negative   respectively  
for the 50 gm 1hr test be apply to total sample of 1251
woman   the revise overall prevalence proportion would be
17 7    confidence limit   15 6   19 9    against the value of
18 9   find among the 891 woman   another outcome of this
study be that the fast plasma glucose estimation be not
necessary for universal screening as this procedure identify
negligible percentage of woman with glucose intolerance
  2 69     who be also not in favour of estimation of fpg for
screen 6
an overall prevalence proportion of gdm at 17 7   in this
rather young population of pregnant woman be
considerably high   subsequent to the observation of the high
prevalence of gdm in one centre   a multicentre study be
initiate in different part of the country in 2002    2003 take
only the 2 hr 75 gm post glucose value of    140 mg dl as
diagnostic criterion for gdm   almost a similar prevalence of
15   be obtain in another govt   maternity hospital
affiliate to madras medical college in the city of chennai  
this trend of high prevalence of gdm be also find in
other part of the country   15   in trivandrum   21   in alwaye  
12   in bangalore   18 8   in erode and 17 5   in ludhiana  
the total number of pregnant woman screen in these
centre be 3674 and an overall gdm prevalence of 16 55  
be observe   this study document a definite increase
trend in the prevalence of gdm compare to that of 2   in
198213 and 7 62   in 1991 14 this trend be also see in other
country   for example in australia at one hospital where the
same testing procedure and diagnostic criterion have be
use for more than 2 decade   the prevalence have more than
double 15
a recent national survey report the prevalence of igt
in the age group of 20 29 year and 30 39 year as 12 2   and
15 3   respectively 16 no gender difference be see in the
prevalence of igt 16 far for a give population and
ethnicity the risk of diabetes and pregnancy   mirror that of
the underlying frequency of type 2 dm in the general
population   17 we also observe in our study that the
prevalence of gdm be close if not similar to the prevalence

rate of igt in our population   with this huge population of
reproductive age in india   a significant segment of woman
with abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy need
cognizance  
our attempt and outcome of the screening for glucose
intolerance during pregnancy have give an insight for the
phenomenal increase in the prevalence of diabete in india  
this view be substantiate by the observation of dabelea et
al on pima indians   the gestational diabetes mellitus have a
far reach consequence in predispose the offspring to
glucose intolerance have be document in pima indians  
the child bear in 1965 to woman with gestational diabetes
be follow up till 2000   by the time they reach 35 year  
more than half of the group have diabete 3 hence as a policy
to identify gdm and its consequence on the infant a 75 gm
ogtt have be recommend to all woman in the population
during the third trimester of pregnancy 3
in india   both undernutrition and overnutrition exist during
pregnancy   there be two report study in india which be
relate to size at birth to future risk of type 2 diabetes   in
mysore   low birth weight do not increase the risk of diabetes
but baby who be short and fat   high body mass index  
bmi   at birth be at increase risk 18 fall et al speculate that
the rise in type 2 diabetes in indian urban population may
have be trigger by mild obesity in mother   lead to
glucose intolerance during pregnancy   macrosomic change
in the fetus and insulin deficiency in adult life 18 yet another
study by yajnik et al attribute high prevalence of type 2 dm
and igt in indian people may be link to poor fetal growth 19
same author also suggest that type 2 dm in india may be
program in fetal life   hence diabete prevention will have
to start in early life   in utero   and continue in later life 20 the
importance be that the intrauterine millieur interieur   whether
one of nutritional deprivation or one of nutritional plenty  
result in change in pancreatic development and peripheral
response to insulin that may lead to adult    onset gdm and
type 2 dm 21
our study favour one step procedure recommend by
who for screen instead of two step procedure use
preliminary screening with 50 gm one hr test   4 table 2 show
the result of the evaluation of the outcome of the 50 gm 1 hr
test   use the outcome of the 75 gm 2 hr test as standard  
the sensitivity of the 50 gm 1 hr test be 79 8   when
compare to the low specificity of 42 7    combine with a
relatively small number of false negative subject   this yield
reasonable high value of sensitivity   79 8    confidence limit  
72 7   85 4    and predictive value of a negative 50 gm 1 hr
test   90 1    confidence limit   86 3   92 9     however   there
be a substantial number of subject false positive for the 50
gm 1 hr test   result in poor value of specificity   42 7   
confidence limit   39 1   46 4    and predictive value of a
positive 50 gm 1 hr test   24 5    confidence limit   21 0 28 3     since the specificity of use 50 gm 1 hr test be low  
instead of perform screening test use 50 gm 1 hr test
and then 100 gm    75 gm ogtt4   a one step procedure of
perform 75gm ogtt directly be ideal as we need to perform
710
 
universal screen for glucose intolerance in pregnancy  
 
conclusion
in conclusion   our study have document the increase
prevalence of gdm in our population and we venture to give
the follow observation and recommendation   universal
screen for glucose intolerance during pregnancy be
essential as indian woman have high prevalence of diabetes
and their relative risk of develop gdm be 11 3 time
compare to white woman 22 asian woman be ethnically more
prone to develop glucose intolerance compare to other
ethnic group 15 gdm base on 2hr 75gm ogtt define by
who predict adverse pregnancy outcome and warrant
treatment 9 a 2 hr 75 gm post plasma glucose    140 mg dl
serve both as screening and diagnostic criterion besides be
a simple and economical one step procedure   as the routine
screen for glucose intolerance during pregnancy be not
do   probably the undiagnosed glucose intolerance that
have be occur in the past have result in the increase
prevalence of diabete in india   the timely action take now
in screen all pregnant woman for glucose intolerance  
achieve euglycemia in they and ensure adequate nutrition
may prevent in all probability   india become diabetes capital
of the world  
  no single period in human development provide a great
potential than pregnancy for long range pay off via relatively
short range period of enlighten metabolic manipulation   norbert frienkel

introduction
treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus
  gdm   aim to reduce hyperglycaemia and
in turn reduce the risk of adverse perinatal
outcome include large for gestational
age   lga    macrosomia   shoulder dystocia  
neonatal hypoglycaemia and the need for
caesarean section   diet modification be often
use as first line treatment   and if partly or wholly
unsuccessful or where woman have substantially
elevate glucose at diagnosis   pharmacological
treatment   metformin   glibenclamide   glyburide   and or insulin   be offer  
 
strength and limitation of this study
    this
 
systematic review evaluate available
intervention for the treatment of gestational
hyperglycaemia and include a network metaanalysis compare all pharmacological treatment
for gestational diabetes  
    a large number of trial conduct in varied
population have be include  
    for some comparison   the number of trial
include be few   and outcome report be
few  
    trial quality be generally poor with subsequent
high or unclear risk of bias  
 
previous systematic review have investigate the effectiveness of treatment for
gdm 1 15 although result from these review
generally indicate that treatment reduce
the risk of adverse perinatal outcome   the
search have variable inclusion criterion
and be undertake between 20091 5 and
20142 4 6 8 10 11 16 16 with three review with
search in 2015 9 14 15 and since then   several
trial have be publish and recommend
criterion for gdm diagnosis have change  
some review have include observational
study   and most do not review all treatment   with the exception of the cochrane
treatment review1   which be now out of date
and have be divide for future update  
and the uk national institute for health
and care excellence   nice   guideline 16
consequently   most previous review do not
provide an assessment of all available treatment   and most have not use a network
meta analysis to determine the most effective
pharmacological treatment across all alternative include in any randomise control
trial   rct   
the aim of this study be to systematically
review and   where appropriate   pool all result
from rct of the effect of any treatment on
gdm and to determine which treatment be
the most effective

discussion
the key finding of our review be that   despite understanding of hyperglycaemia gdm and its relationship
to adverse perinatal outcome having exist for at least
seven decades78 and 42 rct complete on its treatment  
trial be still be conduct that be of limited size
and of poor quality   with subsequent unclear or high
risk of bias    and therefore   which treatment be the most
effective remain unclear   give the change characteristic of the population and the low fast diagnostic
threshold   compare with previous criterion 40 recommend by the international association of diabetes and
pregnancy study group   iadpsg 44 and uk nice 16
it be important to understand how treatment affect
outcome for these woman   trial do not always report
gdm diagnostic criterion clearly   and this be important
consider the potential influence on gdm population size and the magnitude of effect 16 44 our detailed
review   include only evidence from rct   provide
some support for a   step up approach   in the treatment
of hyperglycaemia   from dietary intervention   through
addition of metformin   in preference to glibenclamide

  glyburide    through addition of insulin   consider
that hyperglycaemia in pregnancy have various cause and
many woman will be treat successfully with diet and lifestyle intervention   because low threshold lead to less
severe hyperglycaemia be classify as gdm    use
an integrated individual approach to its management be
likely to work well   although trial and review continue
to be conduct that pay little attention to the influence
of non pharmacological treatment for gdm and often
do not provide information on the severity of hyperglycaemia in treatment group  
we have take a pragmatic approach to evaluate
the many trial examine treatment package of care
for woman diagnose with hyperglycaemia gdm so
that our result will be generalisable to most clinical
situation   several previous review have focus exclusively on pharmacological treatments2 6 8 9 12 15   however  
other have also suggest that package of care with a
  step up   approach be the most effective 1 3 5 the severity
of hyperglycaemia may influence the effectiveness of a
treatment   however   many trial do not report treatment
subgroup baseline glycaemic level   eg   diet only   diet
and metformin or insulin   or metformin with supplementary insulin   34 36 45 47 48 51 62 65 79 for those trial report
baseline glycaemic level by treatment subgroup   there be
inconsistency   with some report significant difference
between groups59 66 and other report no difference 43 58 60 understanding of treatment effect would
be improve if baseline ogtt level be present by
treatment subgroup in future trial  
the number of trial and woman include in previous
review vary   one recent review have broadly similar
inclusion criterion to ours   compare any package of care
for the treatment of gdm with no treatment   routine
care   and include five trial with 2643 woman 3 our
review include all these trial   plus a further seven
  include in the meta analysis   increase the number
of woman to 4512 and indicate that rct in this
area continue to be conduct   but not with the size or
quality that allow we to have a robust evidence base for
the treatment of gdm in a contemporary population  
pool estimate be generally consistent across review
of package of care irrespective of the number of trial
include because estimate be drive in all review by
the two large   which be also the high quality trial  
however   these trial be conduct in population use
diagnostic criterion that would provide population with
more severe hyperglycaemia   and therefore the potential for a large effect size   47 50 for example   our analysis
show the risk of macrosomia be halve when a package
of care be provide compare with routine care   11 trial  
rr 0 49   95   ci 0 39 to 0 62    confirm estimate from
the most recent previous review   rr 0 50   95   ci 0 35 to
0 71   3 these two large and well conduct rct be
publish in 2005 and 2009 47 50 and since then   several
small and poor quality trial have be publish  
these two previous large well conduct trial can not
provide precise estimate of effect on the wide range of

adverse outcome and for woman diagnose use more
recently recommend criterion   hence   we feel that it be
important to place a moratorium on further small rct
in this area and that funder should consider commission a multicentre large scale rct with adequate
power to determine the effect and cost effectiveness
of different package of care on adverse outcome in
woman with gdm  
the evidence to support metformin use   although
encourage   have certain weakness   first   although
there be a general   trend   in favour of metformin use over
insulin and glibenclamide   glyburide    cis be wide   in
both the direct and network meta analysis compare
each two way treatment effect   second   the reporting of
trial method be generally poor with   unclear or high risk
of bias    and many trial include relatively few woman
and report few outcome   third   in most trial directly
compare metformin with insulin   woman receive
metformin be also give supplemental insulin   if
require    in one of the large trial   this equate to 46  
of the metformin group 59 therefore   our result more
appropriately relate to metformin s great effectiveness
as a first line treatment for gdm rather than a standalone
treatment compare with insulin  
in addition to be an effective first line pharmacological treatment for gdm   metformin may also be prefer
by woman as it be administer orally and can be store
at room temperature   compare with insulin that
require subcutaneous injection and refrigerate storage  
metformin be sometimes associate with gastrointestinal
upset   which may affect compliance and quality of life  
few trial have report side effect or measure of
participant satisfaction or well be   all important
outcome that have the potential to impact health and
therefore should be evaluate   recent guidance16 44
recommend low glucose threshold compare with
those previously recommend to diagnose gdm39 40   and
use in the include trial    therefore   it be possible that
a great proportion of woman diagnose with gdm will
require only diet modification or less   intensive   management compare with those previously diagnose with
gdm because their hyperglycaemia be less severe   there
be a continuum of increase risk of adverse outcome
across the spectrum of glucose however80 81   therefore  
intervention to reduce hyperglycaemia even at low
glucose level be likely to improve outcome   but this
need confirm by large well design rct  
strength and limitation
this systematic review and meta analysis include a large
number of trial with varied population and examine
the effectiveness of treatment package and diet as well
as individual pharmacological treatment for reduce
the risk of adverse perinatal outcome  
for some comparison   trial and number of woman
be few   as be outcome report   trial quality be
generally poor with subsequent high or unclear risk of bias  
gdm diagnostic criterion vary across trial   and recently

aim to identify offspring at risk of obesity through its
association with lga   birth weight   90th percentile   
cord c peptide   90th percentile and percentage body

have use these criterion   and the classification of less
severe hyperglycaemia when low glucose threshold
be use to diagnose gdm may reduce the magnitude of
the effect of intervention   compare with those report
by early trial use high glucose threshold   there
have also be no long term follow up conduct to
evaluate the treatment of gdm and the effect on risk of
offspre outcome   importantly   few of the trial that we
review have report side effect or measure of participant satisfaction or well be  
implication for practice
this review provide reassurance that a package of care
where a   step up   approach of first provide dietary and
lifestyle advice   then add supplementary metformin
or insulin if glucose level be not adequately control  
be a reasonable and effective approach compare with

introduction
diabete mellitus   dm   be a group of condition that contribute
significantly to the increase health and financial burden in many
country around the world   1    the prevalence of and screen
method for the clinical subgroup   type 1 diabetes mellitus and
type 2 diabetes mellitus   be relatively well research and
understand in most country   however   those pertain to the
subgroup know as gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be less
establish   2    gestational diabetes mellitus be define by the
world health organization as be    any degree of glucose
intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy    and
should therefore include glucose reading that fall within the
impair glucose tolerance   igt   diagnostic range   as well as those
within the diagnostic range for diabetes   3 4    more recently   the
american diabetes association define gdm as    diabete
diagnose during pregnancy that be not clearly overt diabetes     5

obesity   12 13    with these association in mind it would be
important to identify pregnant woman at risk for gdm so that
prevention management such as lifestyle modification can be
implement   14   
consensus regard screen for and classification of gdm be
yet to be achieve globally   2    the most recognise diagnostic test
for gdm be the oral glucose tolerance test   ogtt   usually
perform between 24 28 week gestation   15    different screening regime for gdm exist and as a result study investigate
prevalence of gdm be often diverse in term of method
employ   cut off value use and consequently   result obtain
  16    table 1 summarise some of the different screening regime
and respective glucose cut off value use to diagnose gdm  
not only do different testing method exist but the availability of
gdm screen differ from country to country and even within
country   although it would be ideal to screen every pregnant
woman for gdm it be not always feasible from a cost perspective  
particularly in low   or middle income country   lmic    in many
lmic   and some high income country   woman tend to be
select for screen only if they fulfil certain gdm riskassociate criterion   17    due to this selective screening process one
may expect the true extent of gdm in such country to remain
relatively unknown   furthermore   prevalence rate may be
dependent upon the specificity and sensitivity of the selective
screen process in identify at   risk woman  
the effect of urbanisation have not only have a profound
impact on develop country   economy but also on public
health   the transition from rural to urban way of life be often
associate with change in eat habit   body mass and
composition   and reduction in physical activity   the movement
towards more westernised diet involve increase consumption of
fat   sugar and refined carbohydrate   as a result   lmic be
experience a rapid increase in overweight and obesity as well as
non communicable disease   such as diabetes   that accompany
such condition   1 18    consider this   the prevalence of gdm
should be increase too   report prevalence figure for gdm in
two high income country   the united kingdom and the united
states of america   be 2 3   and 2 10   respectively   17    a study
that assess gdm in the south of india   a lmic   report a far
great prevalence of 13 9    19    gestational diabetes mellitus
prevalence estimate for another lmic   brazil   be think to be
7 0 7 6    17   
diabetes be essentially unknown in africa in 1901   yet in 2013
19 8 million people be reportedly live with the condition and
this number be predict to increase to 41 5 million in 2035
equate to a 109   increase   20    in africa   the movement from a
rural lifestyle to a more industrial urbanised way of life be largely
responsible for the evolving problem of chronic disease   of which
diabetes be a major contributor   21   
the explosion in the prevalence of diabetes undoubtedly
represent a serious public health burden   in addition   it be more
than likely to bring along with it a considerable increase in gdm  
however   with regard to gdm in africa   the situation appear
relatively unknown   from a cost perspective   many african
country employ a selective screening approach for gdm and
the estimate percentage of pregnant woman screen be unclear
  17    in order to suggest policy change regard screen for
gdm   which will ultimately prevent the effect of gdm on the
mother and her offspring and in turn reduce the financial and
health burden to a country   it be essential that the extent of the
condition be well understand   therefore   we perform a
systematic search to identify research into diagnostic strategy  
screen approach and report gdm prevalence figure on

gestational diabete in africa
 
however   the author state that all woman who test positive
on a glucose challenge screen test should have then be
refer for an ogtt yet only 40   of these woman receive an
ogtt   this suggest that the gdm prevalence could actually
have be high if all woman require an ogtt be in fact
test   the author do report that the gdm prevalence be
similar to the prevalence of type 2 diabete in that population  
unfortunately no reference be make to the ethnicity of the study
participant and consider morocco have several ethnic group it
be difficult to say who this prevalence figure apply to   30    in
addition   the risk of potential bias within this study be high  
mozambique   only one case control study   of relatively poor
report quality and moderate risk of bias   be analyse from
mozambique   the study be conduct in 2002 in an urban

the study report a gdm prevalence of 11   amongst woman
who have late fetal death   case   and 7 3   amongst woman who
have deliver live new born   control    the investigator
diagnose gdm use their own diagnostic criterion which
classify glucose reading for diabetes mellitus and igt as
gdm   31   
nigeria   six nigerian study   all on urban population   be
evaluate   these study be conduct between the year 2004  
2013   27 32 36    five of the six study be classify as have
good fair reporting quality and one be classify as poor   the
risk of bias across the six study range between low   moderate
and high   all the study use the ogtt as the method to detect
gdm but different glucose concentration be employ   50 g  
75 g and 100 g   over a time period of one to three hour  
one study focusse solely on determine the prevalence of
gdm amongst woman with risk factor which include   I   history
of fetal macrosomia    ii   maternal obesity    iii   previous intrauterine
death    iv   first degree relative with diabetes    v   glycosuria and   vi  
history of gdm in a previous pregnancy   27    another two study
be case control study whereby woman with risk factor for
gdm   33   or woman who have deliver macrosomic baby   34  
be classify as case   and woman without risk factor   33   or
woman who have deliver normal weight baby   34   serve as the
control   prevalence of gdm be high amongst the case in
both study   6 2   versus 4 6    utilise the carpenter and
coustan s criterion    33   and 2 5   versus 1 5    utilise the
investigator own diagnostic criterion    34    however   kamanu et
al     2009    who use their own diagnostic criterion as mention
above   diagnose gdm base on a 1 hour 50 g ogtt    
7 8 mmol l 140 mg dl   and only follow up borderline result
with a 75 g 2 hour ogtt   34    usually the 50 g glucose load be
refer to as a glucose challenge test and woman who test positive
on the challenge test be follow up with a further ogtt   this be
refer to as the two step approach   5    it be unconventional for a
50 g ogtt to be perform independently as a diagnostic test
and so the result of this study could be questionable  
exclude the two case control study discuss above   the
other four nigerian study utilise the who diagnostic criterion
  two use the who 1985 criterion and two use the who 1999
criterion    one of these four study compare the detection rate of
the three hour 75 g ogtt use the who 1985 criterion to the
three hour 100 g ogtt use the nddg criterion   the 75 g
ogtt with who 1985 diagnostic criterion yield a high
gdm prevalence   11 6   versus 4 5     conversely   this study
find that the incidence of fetal macrosomia be high   66 7   
amongst woman diagnose with gdm by the 100 g ogtt use

study characteristic
thirteen original research article   one systematic review article
and one abstract pertain to an original research study be
finally include in the systematic review thus total 14 african
research study   figure 1    the systematic review article   28  
discuss study in sub saharan africa and contain suitable
information concern the study for which only an abstract be
available   the early study be publish in 1979 and the late
in 2013   therefore the original individual study include in the
review involve research span 35 year   overall   information
regard gdm classification   screening method and prevalence
be obtain for six african country   ethiopia   morocco  
mozambique   nigeria   south africa and tanzania   two of the
14 study look at gdm prevalence amongst woman with risk
factor   selective screen    another three study be case control
study assess gdm prevalence amongst woman at increase
risk for the condition versus woman without risk factor   and the
remain nine study involve universal gdm screening of
pregnant woman   with reference to table 3  
ethiopia   only one study on gdm in rural ethiopia  
perform over a decade ago   be include   this be a well
report study with a low risk of bias   the ogtt be utilise as
the diagnostic test base on the who 1985 criterion and a gdm
prevalence of 3 7   be report   29   
morocco   the one article pertain to research perform
in urban morocco be publish in 2009 and be write in

south africa   four south african study   conduct between
1979 and 2010   be include in the systematic review   37 40   
one study focus predominantly on indian woman   38    two on
black woman   39 40   and the other do not state the ethnicity of
the woman   37    the study by jackson and coetzee   1979   test
woman for gdm because they have one or more risk factor  
these risk factor include   I   a parent or sible with diabetes    ii  
repeat miscarriage    iii   obesity    iv   previous macrosomic infant  
  v   glycosuria    vi   previous hyperglycaemia    vii   previous infant

  ix   polyhydramnio and   x   indian ethnicity   in addition   this
particular study utilise a 2 hour 50 g ogtt and the
investigator   own diagnostic criterion   37    a 50 g glucose load be
usually use for the glucose challenge test and an ogtt generally
utilise either 75 g or 100 g of glucose   5    the glucose load
choose for an ogtt by the investigator be unusual   however  
this study be perform in 1979 and can therefore be consider
outdate   optimisation of the ogtt for the diagnosis of gdm
have develop and improve greatly since then  
all but one study employ a two hour ogtt for the diagnosis
of gdm   the one study that do not employ an ogtt be
interestingly the most recent study in south africa   conduct in
2010   which test fasting or random blood glucose level and
refer to an institutional protocol for diagnostic criterion   40   
ranchod et al     1991   compare the who 1999 criterion and

discussion
as far as the author be aware   no other systematic review have
assess the prevalence of gdm across the african continent   this
systematic review therefore focusse on study in african
country that provide detail on the gdm screening method
employ   the diagnostic criterion use and the prevalence figure
obtain  
africa consist of 54 country   41   yet only six african
country   equate to a mere 11    be represent in this
systematic review   the percentage of country for which
prevalence figure be find in a systematic review that assess
gdm in asia be 26    42    although still low   this regional
representation be well than the one find in the current review  
this highlight the fact that little seem to be know about the
prevalence and potential burden of gdm in african country  
before health care policy and guideline can successfully be
draw up and implement   it be important for one to establish the
extent of a particular problem   it be evident that the extent of
gdm in africa as a whole be not well investigate   africa have be
plague with under nutrition and gdm may not be consider a
public health concern   however   as african country shift
economically a double burden of under   and over nutrition
emerge   with the increase in over nutrition   particularly in
female   gdm may be naively overlook  
the result of the systematic review illustrate that the majority
of the study test for gdm at around 24 28 week gestation  
the recommend gestational age for when an ogtt should be
perform   42    in addition   the most commonly employ
method for gdm screen in africa be the two hour 75 g
ogtt with glucose reference range as stipulate by the who
1985 or 1999 diagnostic criterion   table 3    two of the report
study make comparison between different diagnostic criterion
and screen method   one of the nigerian study show that
the two hour 75 g ogtt use the who 1985 criterion diagnose
more than double the amount of woman that the 100 g ogtt

gestational diabete in africa
 
strong association between glycosuria   previous hyperglycaemia
and have two or more of the list risk factor with a diagnosis of
gdm   37    these study support that certain maternal risk
factor have a high specificity in identify woman at risk of
develop gdm   this selective screening approach may certainly
have an important role in resource limit setting  
the country with the most study pertain to gdm be
south africa and nigeria   which have four and six study report
respectively   with particular reference to south africa   consider there be 22 million black female live in the country  
represent approximately 80   of the entire female population
  44    two study on gdm in black woman   one in a rural setting
  39   and one in an urban setting   40    involve a total cohort of
approximately 983 woman   can not be consider representative of
the south african gdm scenario   in addition   out of the six
african country for which gdm prevalence figure be
obtain   only nigeria and south africa have report relatively
recent figure on macrosomia rate   in nigeria it be think that
macrosomia account for 7 5    45   to 8 1    46 47   of birth
which tie in with the high gdm prevalence figure of 8 3    35  
and 13 9    27   as report by the two nigerian study in this
review   this suggest macrosomia may be a marker for gdm
prevalence   with respect to south africa   one study conduct on
black patient in urban soweto report a 2 3   macrosomia
prevalence   48   but recent unpublished datum from the south
african department of health indicate a surprisingly low
macrosomia rate of 1 7    49    if macrosomia rate be indicative
of gdm rate then it be imperative that research on gdm be
conduct in other african country   algeria and uganda s
macrosomia prevalence figure be report as 14 9   and 8 4  
respectively   45    this raise concern regard their possible gdm
figure  
it be alarming that very little appear to be know about gdm
in african country   research study   such as those list in this
systematic review   and particularly those that screen all woman in
the study cohort for gdm   be exceptionally useful in assess the
prevalence of the problem   base on the 14 report study
include in the systematic review   if one ignore the prevalence
figure obtain from the two study that focusse on high risk
woman   27 37   and take the prevalence of gdm amongst the
control group in the case control study   31 33 34    and select the
prevalence figure obtain by the who diagnostic criterion as
oppose to those obtain by the nddg criterion in one study   32  
and the dspg of easd criterion in another study   38    the overall
prevalence of gdm in africa be estimate to be approximately 5  
  60 1 12    approximately two and a half to seventeen time great
than some high income country   denmark   2 3     the uk   2  
3    germany   0 3 0 8      17   
interestingly   few study be perform on rural population  
as a direct consequence of urbanisation it would be expect that
the prevalence of gdm would be high amongst urban
population as oppose to rural population   out of the four
south african study   three urban and one rural   the study in rural
limpopo produce the high gdm prevalence   8 8    amongst
a representative sample of local pregnant woman   39    however  
one of the limitation in make comparison between the rural
and urban study in this review be the different gdm screen
method employ and diagnostic criterion use   in addition   some
study look at woman already at high risk for gdm   other
limitation to this review include only publish study   as
oppose to grey literature   be search and roughly one third
of the study include in the review have a high risk of bias and
another third have a moderate risk of bias  
 
use the nddg criterion   32    in addition   one of the south
african study also illustrate a two fold detection rate use the
1985 who criteria versus the dspg of easd criterion   38    base
on these finding   whether the 75 g ogtt over diagnosis gdm
in woman be debatable and warrant further investigation   this
statement be support by the author of the systematic review on
gdm asia who comment that the choice of diagnostic criterion
greatly affect gdm prevalence   43   
many lesson have be learn from the hyperglycemia and
adverse pregnancy outcome   hapo   study which show that
there be a continuous association between maternal blood glucose
level below those diagnostic of diabetes   and adverse outcome  
such as increase neonatal birth weight   44    as a result of these
finding various group have reconsider the diagnostic criterion
for gdm   the iadspg diagnostic criterion and who 2013
diagnostic criterion be not as stringent as some of the other  
previous criterion mainly because only one abnormal value   as
oppose to two   be sufficient to make a diagnosis of gdm   table 1   
as a result of use the new criterion it be very likely that the
prevalence of gdm will increase   this have both positive and
negative consequence   for example   more woman will be
diagnose with gdm and receive treatment and management
which in turn will decrease the effect of maternal hyperglycaemia
on the mother and develop fetus   on the other hand   the health
system in a country could become overburdened with gdm
pregnancy   which could impact heavily on a country s economy
  45    however   consider the potential adverse pregnancy
outcome and the long term effect of gdm on mother and
baby   it may be beneficial to the individual   as well as a country s
health system and economy   to diagnose and manage more
woman than less   none of the study report in this systematic
review use the who 2013 or iadpsg criterion  
the percentage of woman affect with gdm in this review
be as low as 0   in rural tanzania   26   and as high as 13 9  
amongst urban nigerian woman with risk factor   27    this
disparity in prevalence be possibly due to the different methodology
and study design employ across the 14 study   without the
availability of a standardise universal screening protocol the
question be raise as to whether or not the prevalence figure that
be obtain through the various study be in fact true
reflection of the african situation   in addition   with respect to
the discussion above regard the new iadspg and who
2013 diagnostic criterion   should the 14 study report in this
systematic review have utilise either of the say criterion the gdm
prevalence figure obtain would most likely have be great  
two of the study   one perform in nigeria and the other in
south africa   only test woman with risk factor for gdm and
therefore employ the selective screening approach within their
methodology   27 37    certain risk factor have indeed be
prove to be very useful in identify woman at risk for gdm  
when bmi be   30 versus   20 kg m2 a woman have a three time
great risk of develop gdm   ethnicity be also another key
factor for assess the risk of develop gdm   asian woman be
five time more likely to develop gdm than caucasian woman  
and african american woman be two time more likely to
develop gdm than caucasian woman   2    the study by kuti et
al     2012   in nigeria report a high gdm prevalence   13 9   
amongst these woman and the author find the strong
association between the follow risk factor and a diagnosis of
gdm   be over 30 year of age   although this be not use as a
risk factor in the sample selection process    have a family history
of diabetes and having previously be diagnose with gdm   27

gestational diabete in africa
 
this systematic review have illustrate a gap in the knowledge of
gdm in africa with only 11   of the african continent be
represent   more epidemiological base study on gdm in
african country need to be perform in order to provide reliable
information and thus clarity on the extent of gdm   an ideal
scenario would be if one set of diagnostic criterion and one testing
method be employ across the continent in order to produce
comparable datum   in addition   comparison between gdm
prevalence amongst rural and urban population within a country
should be carry out in order to assess the extent of the effect of
urbanisation on public health  
understanding and subsequently attempt to curb the
prevalence of gdm in develop country be imperative for
maternal and child health   as gdm often result in macrosomic
infant   birth trauma and the need for caesarean section at
delivery be expect   this be precarious as it impact both
maternal and child survival during delivery   and place a
significant economic burden on the health system   which in many
african country be already struggle with limited resource  
furthermore   for most country macrosomia appear to have
be overlook with the justified focus on low birth weight and
small for gestational age statistic   the developmental origin of
health and disease research describe how the develop fetus be
susceptible to its environment and that certain in utero event can in
fact alter fetal programming and produce different phenotype  
low birth weight be representative of poor fetal nutrition and
growth   and have be show to be associate with a range of
chronic condition   include type 2 diabetes   50    however   high
birth weight require as much consideration as there be evidence to
support that fetal over nutrition also pose risk for type 2 diabetes
and other chronic condition later in life   51    with the emerge
increase in type 2 diabetes and obesity   macrosomia will become
an important factor in maternal and child health and should be
report on and monitor by the health care system as a marker
for gdm soon than later  
 
as africa continue along its economic and concomitant
urbanisation and lifestyle transition   the double burden of both
under   and over nutrition be a cause for concern   therefore  
epidemiologist   public health specialist   health professional   and
policy leader need to place gdm and macrosomia as key
element in their maternal and child health framework   thus
enable policy and practice to minimise the risk of maternal
impair glucose metabolism during pregnancy

epidemiology
the prevalence of gdm in india vary from 3 8 to 21   in different part of the
country   depend on the geographical location and diagnostic method use  
gdm have be find to be more prevalent in urban area than in rural area   4 11   
for a give population and ethnicity   the prevalence of gdm correspond to the
prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance   igt   in non pregnant adult   within that
give population   12

different country   american diabetes association   ada   recommend screen
 
 
page 3 of 25
 
for selective   high risk   population   but compare to selective screen   universal
screen for gdm detect more case and improve maternal and neonatal
prognosis   13   14    hence universal screening for gdm be essential   as it be generally
accept that woman of asian origin and especially ethnic indians   be at a high
risk of develop gdm and subsequent type 2 diabetes   15   16   17   
ada procedure
ada recommend two step procedure   step 1   a 50 g glucose challenge test   gct  
be use for screen without regard to the time of last meal or time of the day   18   
step 2   if 1 hour gct value be more than 140 mg dl   100 g oral glucose tolerance

value meet or exceed fpg    95 mg dl   1 hr pg    180 mg dl   2 hr pg    155 mg dl
and 3 hr pg    140 mg dl   the drawback of this criterion be that   the glycemic cut off
be originally validate against the future risk of these woman develop diabete
and not on the fetal outcome   19    far   in the community health center  
pregnant woman be reluctant to undergo ada procedure for two reason   20  
21 22  
1   the number of blood sample draw be many   a   for screening and   b   for
subsequent 3   hour ogtt to confirm the diagnosis   4 blood sample   
2   they have to visit the ante natal clinic on two occasion     a   for screen
and   b   again for diagnostic procedure  
who procedure
when a glucose tolerance test be administer to a non pregnant individual   it be
standard to use the 75 g   2 hour ogtt   use a different glucose challenge in
pregnant versus non pregnant person lead to confusion in the laboratory and may
result in error in apply the proper diagnostic criterion   23    to standardize the
diagnosis of gdm   the world health organization   who   recommend use a 2
hour 75 gm ogtt with a threshold plasma glucose concentration of great than 140

  24    who procedure also have a shortcoming in that   the criterion suggest for
diagnosis of gdm be also not base on the maternal and fetal outcome but
probably the criterion be recommend for its easy adaptability in clinical practice  
reconciliation factor between ada and who
gdm base on two hour 75gm ogtt define by either who or ada criterion

increase maternal carbohydrate intolerance in pregnant woman be associate with
a grade increase in the adverse maternal and fetal outcome   27    the primary
outcome of both birth weight and serum c peptide level    90th percentile occur at
the cut point of 2 hr pg    140 mg dl   28    in yet another follow up study of child
bear to mother who have third trimester plasma glucose   120 139 mg dl   the
cumulative risk of type 2 diabetes be 19   at age 24 year and this risk increase to
30   with respect to those woman who have 2 h plasma glucose 140   199 mg dl   29   
thus both short term and long term morbidity in the offspring occur at the
inflective cut point of maternal 2 hr plasma glucose    140 mg dl and as such   this
level assume clinical significance   a pregnant woman   whose 2 hour plasma glucose
be 120 139 mg dl   need follow up   30   
a single test procedure to diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus in the community
seldom   a pregnant woman visit the ante natal clinic for the first time come in
the fast state   if she be ask to come on another day in the fast state she may
not return   19   20   21    hence it be important to have a test that detect the glucose
intolerance without the woman necessarily undergo a test in the fast state and
it be preferable to perform the diagnostic test at the first visit itself  
 
in the antenatal clinic   a pregnant woman after undergo preliminary clinical
examination   have to be give a 75 g oral glucose load    without regard to the time of
the last meal   a venous blood sample be collect at 2 hour for estimate plasma
glucose by the god pod method   gdm be diagnose if 2 hr plasma glucose be

   if 75 g glucose packet be not available   remove 5 level teaspoon   not heap   of glucose from
a 100 g packet which be freely available   in hospital where glucose be supply in bulk   a cup
or container of 75 g may be use  
perform this test procedure in the non fast state be rational   as glucose
concentration be affect little by the time since the last meal in a normal glucose
tolerant woman   whereas it will   in a woman with gestational diabetes   31    after a
 
 
page 6 of 25
 
meal   a normal glucose tolerant woman would be able to maintain euglycemia
despite glucose challenge due to brisk and adequate insulin response   whereas   a
woman with gdm who have impair insulin secretion   32    her glycemic level
increase with a meal and with glucose challenge   the glycemic excursion
exaggerate furth   33    therefore   this procedure assume clinical relevance as
who criteria base on glucose concentration 2 h after 75 g glucose load be able to
correctly identify subject with gdm   34    yet another reason for recommend the
single step procedure be that   the specificity of ada screen with 50 gm 1 hr gct
without regard to time of the last meal be low   22    hence   instead of perform

clarity in label the different magnitude of abnormal glucose intolerance in
pregnancy

document that   the cumulative risk of type 2 diabetes at 24 year in the offspring
bear to mother who have third trimester plasma glucose   120 139 mg dl be 19  
  29    in the same study   the cumulative risk be find to be 30   in offspring bear to
woman who have 2 h plasma glucose    140 mg dl   29    hence it may be prudent to

gestational week at which screening be recommend
insulin be detectable in the fetal pancrea as early as 9 week after conception   40   
an increase in pancreatic beta cell mass and insulin secretion in the fetus occur by
the 16th week of gestation   in response to maternal hyperglycemia   41   42   
the priming of the fetal beta cell may account for the persistence of fetal
hyperinsulinemia throughout pregnancy and the risk of accelerate fetal growth
  43    even when the mother enjoy good metabolic control in later pregnancy   44   
this necessitate perform the test procedure to diagnose gdm in the first
trimester itself   further   early detection and care result in a well fetal outcome   45   
 
by follow the usual recommendation for screen between 24 and 28 week of
gestation   the chance of detect unrecognized type 2 diabetes before pregnancy
  pre   gdm   be likely to be miss   46   47    if the 2    h pg be    200 mg dl in the early

obstetrician   diabete physician   a diabetes educator   dietitian   midwife and
pediatrician

the importance of educate woman with gdm   and their partner   about the
condition and its management can not be overemphasize

target blood glucose level
in normal pregnancy   the mean plasma glucose   mpg     1 sd value for fasting be 89
mg dl   and 2    hour be 122 mg dl    diabete in pregnancy awareness and
prevention   dipap   n    12   056   4   5   50    the occurrence of birth weight    90th
percentile   macrosomia   be continuum as fast plasma glucose increase    90
mg dl   50   and the 2 hr plasma glucose    120 mg dl   30    thus   maintenance of
mean plasma glucose   mpg   level    105 to 110 mg dl be desirable for a good fetal
outcome   51   52    this be possible if fpg and 2 hour post prandial peak be   90
mg dl and   120 mg dl respectively  
medical nutrition therapy   mnt  
a   general principle   all woman with gdm should receive nutritional
counsel   the meal pattern should provide adequate calorie and nutrient
to meet the need of pregnancy   the expect weight gain during pregnancy
be 300 to 400 gm week and total weight gain be 10 to 12 kg by term   hence the
meal plan aim to provide sufficient calorie to sustain adequate nutrition for
the mother and fetus and to avoid excess weight gain and post prandial
hyperglycemia   calorie requirement depend on age   activity   pre pregnancy
weight and stage of pregnancy   approximately 30 to 40 kcal kg ideal body
weight or an increment of 300 kcal day above the basal requirement be
need in 2nd and 3rd trimester   pregnancy be not the ideal time for obesity
correction   underweight subject or those not gain weight as expect  
particularly in the third trimester   require admission to ensure adequate
nutrition to prevent low birth weight infant  
b   calorie count   as a part of the medical nutrition therapy   pregnant diabetic
woman be advise to wisely distribute their calorie consumption especially
the breakfast   this imply split the usual breakfast into two equal half
and consume the portion with a two hour gap in between   by this the
 
 
page 10 of 25
 
undue peak in plasma glucose level after ingestion of the total quantity of
breakfast at one time be avoid   for example if 4 idlis    chappathi    slice of
bread   apply to all type of breakfast menu   be take for breakfast at 8 am and
two hour plasma glucose at 10 am be 140 mg dl   the same quantity divide
into two equal portion I e    one portion at 8 am and remain after 10 am  
the two hour post prandial plasma glucose at 10 00 am fall by 20    30
mg dl   more than 90    of gdm can be manage by mnt   observation from
the diabetes in pregnancy awareness    prevention   dipap   project  
support by the government of tamil nadu and world diabete
foundation   wdf    
explanatory note  
this advice   of split the breakfast into two portion   have scientific basis as the
peaking of plasma glucose be high with breakfast   due to dawn phenomenon   than
with lunch and dinner   in a normal person   insulin secretion be high with breakfast
than with lunch or dinner   53    whereas   gdm mother have deficiency in first phase
insulin secretion and to match this insulin deficiency the challenge of quantity of
food at one time should also be less  
initiate insulin therapy
once diagnosis be make   medical nutritional therapy   mnt   be advise initially for
two week   if mnt fail to achieve control I e    fpg    90 mg dl and post meal
glucose    120 mg dl   insulin may be initiate  
a   preferable to start with premix insulin 30 70 of any brand    
start dose   4 unit before breakfast
every 4th day increase 2 unit till 10 unit
if fpg remain    90 mg dl advise
 
6 unit before breakfast    4 unit before dinner
 
review with blood sugar test
 
adjust dose further
 
 
page 11 of 25
 
total insulin dose per day can be divide as 2 3 in the morning and 1 3 in the evening  
   initially if post breakfast plasma glucose be high
 
start premix 50 50
 
b   if gdm be diagnose in the third trimester   mnt be advise for a week  
insulin be initiate if mnt fail  
c   if 2   hour pg    200 mg dl at diagnosis   a starting dose of 8 unit of premixed
insulin could be administer straightaway before breakfast and the dose have to be
titrate on follow up   along with insulin therapy   mnt be also advise  
 
insulin analog
if post prandial glucose be still not under control    consider use rapid acting
insulin analog  
 
rapid act insulin analogue    aspart    novorapid   lispro   humalog   have be
find to be safe and effective in achieve the target post prandial glucose value
during pregnancy   54    lispro analogue be approve by us fda and aspart have
be approve for use in pregnancy both by we fda and european union   biasp
  novomix   have be find to be safe and effective in the management of gdm   55   
 
pen injector be very useful and the patient s acceptance be excellent  
note  
 
1   usually woman with gestational diabete do not require    20 unit of
insulin per day for glycemic control   40    in comparison to type 1 and type
2 pregnant woman whose daily requirement of insulin may be high  
2   pre gestational diabetic woman during pregnancy may require high dose
of insulin   a few may require multiple daily injection   mdi    usually
give as short act insulin before breakfast and lunch and intermediate  
act insulin or pre mix before dinner  
3   insulin dose be always individualized and have to be adjust on follow up  
 
 
page 12 of 25
 
4   if insulin requirement drop   placental insufficiency or fetal jeopardy have
to be suspect   may also be due to increase utilization of maternal
glucose by the supercharge beta cell mass of the macrosomic fetus   40    
  fetal handling of maternal glucose    
monitor glycemic control
the success of the treatment for a woman with gdm depend on the glycemic
control maintain with meal plan or pharmacological intervention   study suggest
1   1 ½ and 2 hour post meal for monitor glycemic control   56 63    two hour post
meal monitoring be prefer as the diagnosis of gdm be also base on 2 hour
plasma glucose   it be easy to remember this timing   as the time for diagnosis and
also for monitoring be the same I e 2 hour  
they should be advise to perform self monitoring of blood glucose   smbg   on a
daily basis   failing which   at least weekly monitoring should be encourage   if selfmonitore be not possible   laboratory venous plasma glucose have to be estimate for
adjust the dose of insulin  
 
explanatory note  
gdm woman usually have high post breakfast plasma glucose level compare to
post lunch and post dinner   the period between breakfast and lunch be often
problematical because of the physiological tendency to hyperglycemia at this time  
and may necessitate substantial increase in the morning dose of short acting
insulin   together with careful adjustment of meal timing and snack to avoid
hypoglycemia   40    a few gdm woman may have high post lunch and dinner
plasma glucose   insulin dose have to be adjust by frequent monitoring of
postprandial blood glucose

if the glucose intolerance be detect in the early pregnancy   a1c level will be helpful
to differentiate between a pre gestational diabetic and gdm   if the a1c level be more

to determine whether the glucose tolerance have return to normal or progress   a
considerable proportion of gestational diabetic woman may continue to have glucose

it be important that woman with gdm be counsel with regard to their increase

high risk of develop diabete   especially type 2 diabetes mellitus    and metabolic
syndrome at a comparatively young age   71   74    they should be make aware of the
symptom of hyperglycemia and advice should be give about the importance of
healthy eating and exercise pattern   contraceptive advice and counseling regard

the diabetes in pregnancy study group india   dipsi   be report practice guideline for gdm in the indian
environment   due to high prevalence   screening be essential for all indian pregnant woman   dipsi recommend
that as a pregnant woman walk into the antenatal clinic in the fast state   she have to be give a 75 g oral
glucose load and at 2 hrs a venous blood sample be collect for estimate plasma glucose   this one step
procedure of challenge woman with 75 gm glucose and diagnose gdm be simple   economical and feasible  
screening be recommend between 24 and 28 week of gestation and the diagnostic criterion of ada be
applicable   a team approach be ideal for manage woman with gdm   the team would usually comprise an
obstetrician   diabete physician   a diabetes educator   dietitian   midwife and pediatrician   intensive monitoring  
diet and insulin be the corner stone of gdm management   oral agent or analogue though use be still
controversial   until there be evidence to absolutely prove that ignore maternal hyperglycemia when the
fetal growth pattern appear normal on the ultrasonogram   it be prudent to achieve and maintain
normoglycemia in every pregnancy complicate by gestational diabete   the maternal health and fetal outcome

tune of glycemic level during pregnancy be possible
due to the compensatory hyperinsulinaemia   as the
normal pregnancy be characterize by insulin resistance  
a pregnant woman who be not able to increase she
insulin secretion to overcome the insulin resistance that
occur even during normal pregnancy develop
gestational diabetes  
the metabolic goal of pregnancy be 1   in early pregnancy
to develop anabolic store to meet metabolic demand in
late pregnancy and 2   in late pregnancy to provide fuel
for fetal growth and energy need  
   dr patrick catalano
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be define as
  carbohydrate intolerance with recognition or onset during
pregnancy    irrespective of the treatment with diet or
insulin   the importance of gdm be that two generation
be at risk of develop diabete in the future   woman
with a history of gdm be at increase risk of future
diabetes   predominately type 2 diabetes   as be their
children1
gdm occur when the woman s beta cell function be not
able to overcome the antagonism create by the anti insulin
hormone of pregnancy and the increase fuel consumption
require to provide for the grow fetomaternal unit

screen
the controversy concern optimal strategy still
continue for the detection and diagnosis of gdm  
american diabetes association   ada   recommend two
step procedure for screening and diagnosis of diabetes
and that too in selective   high risk   population  
compare with selective screening   universal screening
for gdm detect more case and improve maternal and
neonatal prognosis 3 in the indian context   screening be
essential in all pregnant woman as the indian woman
have 11 fold increase risk of develop glucose
intolerance during pregnancy compare to caucasian
woman 4 the recent datum on the prevalence of gdm in
our country be 16 55   by who criterion of 2 hr pg   
140 mg dl   5 as such universal screening during
pregnancy have become important in our country   for
this we need a simple procedure which be economical
and feasible  
dipsi recommend method
as a pregnant woman walk into the antenatal clinic
in the fast state   she have to be give a 75 g oral glucose
load and at 2 hrs a venous blood sample be collect for
estimate plasma glucose   this one step procedure of
challenge woman with 75 gm glucose and diagnose
gdm be simple   economical and feasible 6
 
diagnostic criterion
american diabetes association   carpenter and
couston   recommend 3 hour 100 gm ogtt and
gestational diabetes mellitus be diagnose if any 2
value meet or exceed fpg    95 mg dl   1 hr pg    180
mg dl   2 hr pg    155 mg dl and 3 hr pg    140 mg dl  
this criterion be originally validate against the future
risk of these woman develop diabete and not on the
fetal outcome   carpenter himself now recommend a 2
hour ogtt with 75 gm glucose   the reason for this be
that   when a glucose tolerance test be administer to
non pregnant individual   it be standard to use the 75 g  
2 hour ogtt   use a different glucose challenge in
pregnant versus non pregnant patient lead to
confusion in the laboratory and may result in error in
apply the proper diagnostic criterion   far   the 75 g   2 hour ogtt be in use during pregnancy in many
country around the world   typically use the same
threshold as in non pregnant individual    7 to
standardize the diagnosis of gdm   the world health
organisation   who   propose use a 2 hour 75 gm
ogtt with a threshold plasma glucose concentration
of great than 140 mg dl at 2 hour   similar to that of
igt   outside pregnancy 8 still all these recommendation
  ada and who   have not project the influence of the
glycemic level on fetal outcome  
clarity in label the different magnitude of
abnormal glucose intolerance on pregnancy
increase maternal carbohydrate intolerance in
   japi    vol   54    august 2006
 
pregnant woman without gdm be associate with a
grade increase in adverse maternal and fetal outcomes9
imply that fetal morbidity start at a low maternal
glycemic level     140 mg dl    a number of prospective
and retrospective study have substantiate the
observation that the frequency of adverse fetal outcome
increase with 2hr pg    120 mg dl and take care of
these woman have result in a well fetal outcome 10 14
thus   the datum be robust and indicate that 2 hr    120 mg  
dl need cognizance  
the term   impair gestational glucose tolerance
  iggt    be use by few author to indicate pregnant
woman whose 2 hr pg be    120 mg dl   it may be
appropriate to use the term   decrease gestational
glucose tolerance   dggt    instead of impaired
gestational glucose tolerance   the use of the term
  decrease   be appropriate as it imply only   low  
whereas the term   impair   mean both high and low  
far   quiet frequently we come across   label any
abnormal value in the ogtt not meet the diagnostic
criterion of gdm as igt 15 the use of this term   igt   during
pregnancy may be confuse   as this terminology be also
be use in non pregnant adult with 2 hr pg    140
mg dl   this level be also apply to diagnose gdm by
who criteria   hence it may be prudent to label 2 hr
plasma glucose value    140 mg dl as gdm and a 2 hr
plasma glucose value    120 mg dl as   decrease
gestational glucose tolerance    dggt    the term igt
should not be use to denote any abnormal value during
pregnancy   the figure suggest below be easy to

gestational week at which screening be
recommend
practically all the pregnant woman should undergo
screen for glucose intolerance   the usual
recommendation for screening be between 24 and 28
week of gestation   the recent concept be to screen for
glucose intolerance in the first trimester itself as the fetal
beta cell recognize and respond to maternal glycemic
level as early as 16th week of gestation 16 if find negative
at this time   the screening test be to be perform again
around 24th    28th week and finally around 32nd    34th
week  
 
management of gdm
a team approach be ideal for manage woman with
gdm   the team would usually comprise an obstetrician  
diabetes physician   a diabetes educator   dietitian  
midwife and pediatrician   in practice   however   the team
approach be not always possible due to limited resource

in such circumstance   management by an obstetrician
and physician   with the assistance of an appropriately
skilled dietitian   diabete educator   be acceptable  
a   patient education
the importance of educate woman with gdm   and
their partner   about the condition and its management
can not be overemphasize  
the compliance with the treatment plan depend on
the patient s understanding of  
 
the implication of gdm for her baby and herself
 
the dietary and exercise recommendation
 
self monitoring of blood glucose
 
self administration of insulin and adjustment of
insulin dose
 
identification and treatment of hypoglycemia
  patient and family member  
incorporate safe physical activity
 
development of technique to reduce stress and cope
with the denial  
care should be take to minimise the anxiety of the
woman  
b   medical nutrition therapy   mnt  
a   general principle    all woman with gdm should
receive nutritional counseling   the meal pattern should
provide adequate calorie and nutrient to meet the
need of pregnancy   the expect weight gain during
pregnancy be 300 to 400 gm week and total weight gain
be 10 to 12 kg by term   hence the meal plan aim to
provide sufficient calorie to sustain adequate nutrition
for the mother and fetus and to avoid excess weight gain
and post prandial hyperglycemia   calorie requirement
depend on age   activity   pre pregnancy weight and stage
of pregnancy   approximately 30 to 40 kcal kg ideal body
weight or an increment of 300 kcal day above the basal
requirement be need   pregnancy be not the ideal time
for obesity correction   underweight subject or those
not gain weight as expect   particularly in the third
trimester   require admission to ensure adequate nutrition
to prevent low birth weight infant  
b   calorie count    as a part of the medical nutrition
therapy   pregnant diabetic woman be advise to wisely
distribute their calorie consumption especially the
breakfast   this imply split the usual breakfast into
two equal half and consume the portion with a
two hour gap in between   by this the undue peak in
plasma glucose level after ingestion of the total quantity
of breakfast at one time be avoid   for example if 4 idlis
   chappathi    slice of bread   apply to all type of
breakfast menu   be take for breakfast at 8 am and two
hour plasma glucose at 10 am be 140 mg   the same
quantity divide into two equal portion I e    one portion
at 8 am and remain after 10 be   the two hour post
prandial plasma glucose at 10 00 am fall by 20    30 mg  
 
 
624
 
this advice have scientific basis as the peaking of
plasma glucose be high with breakfast   due to dawn
phenomenon   than with lunch and dinner   far in a
normal person   insulin secretion be also high with
breakfast than with lunch or dinner 17 gdm mother have
deficiency in first phase insulin secretion and to match
this insulin deficiency the challenge of quantity of food
at one time should also be less  
insulin therapy
insulin be essential if medical nutrition therapy fail
to achieve euglycemia   various criterion have be
propose for the initiation of insulin therapy   fourth
international workshop on gdm recommend
lower capillary blood glucose concentration to 140
mg dl at 1 hour and 120 mg dl at 2 hour 18 whereas
ada recommend the option of measure 1 hour post
meal value with cut off of 120 mg dl   19 these
recommendation be base on one single determination  
which reflect a   snap shot   of glucose evaluation rather
than a   video   of continuous glucose profile 20 the
continuous glucose monitoring system have establish
that in normal pregnancy   peak plasma glucose occur
at 60 minute and the value be 108 7    16 9 mg dl 1 in
a woman with gdm   the peak occur between 70    110
minute   at approximately 90 minute   and with a good
glycemic control the value be 103    26 mg dl   20
however   be interstitial fluid glucose it have its own
limitation  
if the fpg concentration on the ogtt be   120 mg dl  
then the patient be start on insulin immediately along
with meal plan   other gdm woman be see within 3
day and be also teach self monitoring of blood glucose
  smbg    smbg be to be perform in fasting and 1 ½
hour after each meal   gdm woman usually have high
post breakfast plasma glucose level compare to post
lunch and post dinner   a few gdm woman do have
post dinner plasma glucose also high   insulin be start
within 1 to 2 week   if the majority   I e    at least four of
seven per week   of fast value exceed 90 mg dl  
similarly   if the majority of post prandial value after a
particular meal exceed 120 mg dl   insulin be start 21
pen injector be very useful and the patient s acceptance
be excellent  
the initial dose of nph insulin could be as low as 4
unit and the dose of insulin can be adjust on follow
up   a few gdm patient may require combination of
short act insulin and intermediate act insulin in
the morning and evening  
 
if a patient have elevate prelunch blood sugar  
regular insulin be usually necessary in the morning
to handle the post breakfast hyperglycemia   as there
be a lag period before the intermediate act insulin
begin to work   the above regimen of regular and
intermediate act insulin in the morning control
hyperglycemia in most case

   japi    vol   54    august 2006
 
 
 
 
 
 
if the post dinner blood sugar be high   a small dose
of regular insulin be necessary before dinner in
addition to the regular and intermediate acting
insulin give in the morning  
combination of regular and intermediate acting
insulin before dinner may be necessary if fast
blood sugar be high   this combination of short and
intermediate act insulin in the morning and as
well as in the evening be know as mixed and split
dose of insulin regimen   in this regimen two third
of the total daily dose of insulin be give in the
morning and one third in the evening   for each
combination one third dose should be regular
insulin and two third intermediate act insulin  
with this regiman if the patient continue to have
fast hyperglycemia   the intermediate acting
insulin have to be give at bedtime instead of before
dinner   insulin dose be individualize  
 
target blood glucose level
maintenance of mean plasma glucose   mpg   level   
105 mg   be ideal for good fetal outcome 22 this be possible
if fpg and post prandial peak be around 90 mg dl
and 120 mg dl respectively   mpg should not be    86
mg dl as this may cause small for gestational age
infant   22
specie of insulin
it be ideal to use human insulin be least
immunogenic   though insulin do not cross the
placenta   the insulin antibodie due to animal source
insulin can cross the placenta   and stress the fetal beta
cell   increase insulin production and induce
macrosomia   rapid act insulin analogue  
  novorapid humalog   have be find to be safe and
effective in achieve the target post prandial glucose
value during pregnancy 23 lyspro the first analogue to
get category b approval by us fda and aspart have also
be use in pregnancy  
oral antidiabetic drug
recently report have show good fetal outcome in
gdm woman who be on glyburide   micronise form
of glibenclamide    a randomize unblinded clinical trial
compare the use of insulin and glyburide in woman
with gdm who be not able to meet glycemic goal on
meal plan   treatment with either agent result in similar
perinatal outcome   all these patient be beyond the
first trimester of pregnancy at the initiation of therapy 24
more study be require before routinely
recommend glibenclamide during pregnancy
especially during the first trimester itself   metformin have
be find to be useful in woman with polycystic
ovarian disease   pcod   who fail to conceive  
continue this drug after conception be still a
controversy   but there be a few study favour
continuation of metformin throughout pregnancy 25
currently   oral agent be not routinely recommend
   japi    vol   54    august 2006
 
during pregnancy though emerge datum on
glibenclamide and metformin be interesting  
 
monitor glycemic control
the success of the treatment for a woman with gdm
depend on the glycemic control maintain with meal
plan or pharmacological intervention   to know the
effectiveness of treatment   monitoring of glycemic control
be essential  
 
once diagnosis be make   medical nutritional therapy
  mnt   be advise initially for two week   if mnt
fail to achieve control I e    fpg    90 mg dl and or
1 ½ hr ppg    120 mg dl   insulin may be initiate  
 
once target blood glucose be achieve   woman with
gdm till the 28th week of gestation require lab
monitoring of both fasting and 1 ½ hr post breakfast
once a month and at other time of the day as the
clinician decide  
 
after the 28th week of gestation   the laboratory
monitoring should be more frequent atleast once in
2 week   if need be more frequently  
 
after 32 week of gestation   lab monitoring should
be do once a week till delivery  
 
in high risk pregnancy   frequency of monitor
may be intensify with smbg  
 
continuous glucose monitoring device be available
but these equipment need special training and be
expensive   these device may be useful in high risk
pregnancy to know the glycemic fluctuation and
to plan proper insulin dosage  
throughout the stage and phase of a diabetic woman   her
health status be directly dependent on her nutritional status
and her blood glucose control   as a woman age   to prevent
the increase risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease
of the diabetic woman   exercise and hormonal replacement
therapy can minimize the ravage of diabete per se on the
age process   normoglycemia throughout the lifecycle of
a diabetic woman result in a lifecycle of health  
   dr lois jovanovic
hba1c level
if the glucose intolerance be detect in the early
pregnancy   hba1c level will be helpful to differentiate
between a pre gestational diabetic and gdm   if the
hba1c level be more than 6    she be likely to be a pre
gdm   hba1c be useful in monitor the glucose control
during pregnancy   but not for the day to day
management   a1c level may serve as a prognostic value  
estimation of fructosamine during pregnancy be less
frequently use  
measure other parameter
the blood pressure have to be monitor during every
visit   examination of the fundus and estimation of
microalbuminuria   every trimester be recommend

e   ultrasound fetal measurement    the management of
gestational diabete   base on the foetal growth by
ultrasonogram demand that the fetus at risk must first
manifest overgrowth before treatment decision be
make   further   the cost of perform a number of
ultrasonograms to monitor the foetal growth and
recommend therapy have to be keep in mind   until
there be evidence to absolutely prove that ignore
maternal hyperglycemia when the fetal growth pattern
appear normal on the ultrasonogram   it be prudent to
achieve and maintain normoglycemia in every
pregnancy complicate by gestational diabete

obstetric consideration
fetal evaluation
an ultrasound scan have to be perform around 18   
20 week of gestation focus on structure namely the
spine   skull   kidney and heart   fetal echocardiography
have to be do around 20    24 week which allow to
view all the four chamber of the heart   from 26th week
onwards   fetal growth and liquor volume have to be
monitor every 2 3 week   fetal abdominal
circumference provide baseline for further serial
measurement which give growth acceleration or
restriction   fetal movement be monitor from 20 week
onwards   screen for chromosomal anomaly be
necessary in pre gdm   screening should be do for
down s syndrome   alpha feto protein for neural defect
and human chorionic gonadotrophin to identify any
chromosomal abnormality   16    20 week of gestation   
the obese fetus of gdm mother be also hyperinsulinemic  
thus interaction between leptin and insulin may be a link
between maternal diabete and increase adiposity in the
fetus  
   dr sylvie hauguel de mouzon
gdm or severe obesity be superimpose to pregnancy   the
result metabolic syndrome become detrimental for the
fetus   evolve towards fetal overgrowth with increase
adiposity at birth   this may be one major component for in
utero programming of obesity later in life  
   dr sylvie hauguel de mouzon
timing of delivery
sudden intrauterine fetal demise in the third trimester
of diabetic pregnancy be not uncommon   to avoid this
risk   preterm delivery be recommend   but with this  
respiratory distress syndrome   rd   be likely to occur  
administer steroid for lung maturity or ß adreno
626
 
receptor agonist to inhibit premature uterine contraction
be likely to induce adverse metabolic effect due to their
glycolytic   glycogenolytic and lipolytic effect   in this
situation   extra insulin may be require to maintain
euglycemia   foetal demise can also occur due to
preeclampsia   which can produce fetal hypoxia via
decrease uteroplacental perfusion   some centre allow
woman with uncomplicated diabete to go into
spontaneous labor irrespective of the gestational age  
but most still advocate delivery at 38 week as perinatal
mortality and morbidity appear to increase after this
time   induction at 38 week gestation may be slow or
unsuccessful due to unfavourable condition of the
cervix but this have to be balance against the poorly
define and predictable risk of late intra uterine death  
if pregnancy be allow to continue more than 38 week  
fetal health may deteriorate suddenly   hence obstetric
management should not be rigid and each case need
individual care and attention   have a neonatologist
support at the time of delivery be advisable  
intra partum management
 
if labor be to be induce in gdm   the usual evening
insulin dose should be take the night before   but
no subcutaneous insulin be give the following
morning when induction begin  
 
once labor begin   insulin be not necessary  
 
in a gestational diabetic the requirement of insulin
be likely to fall precipitously and no insulin may be
require immediately after expulsion of placenta  
 
delivery
a paediatrician experience in resuscitation of   the
newborn should be present whether delivery be vaginal
or by caesarean section   as soon as the infant be bear  
the follow action be mandatory  
 
early clamp of the cord   I e   within 20 second of

keyword   gestational diabetes
 
1   introduction
a worldwide rise trend in obesity have be report from 1975 to 2016   affect female and
male alike   1    in woman   the rise obesity have lead to an increase in the incidence of gestational diabete
mellitus   gdm   as well as associate pregnancy and perinatal complication   know non modifiable
risk factor for predisposition to gdm include advanced maternal age   ethnicity   and family history of
type 2 diabetes mellitus   2    maternal obesity independently contribute to the development of gdm   3   
the center of disease control   cdc   estimate that the incidence of gdm in the united states   we   be
about 10    it be report to be high in some country with rate as high as 17 8 41 9   when use
the international association of diabetes in pregnancy study group   iadpsg   gdm criterion   4 5   
in western country   a body mass index   bmi   of   25 kg m2 be consider normal  
the recommendation for pharmacotherapy in patient with gdm have evolve over the past
two decade   in this review   we provide an overview of the condition   with emphasis on the evolution
of medical management over the past century   we have include the recent datum on the option for
medical management   as well as datum on the current recommendation base on safety datum of these

a limit factor in this literature search   the publication include in this review be restrict to
english language   the diagnosis of gdm in this review be base on the definition recommend by
the american college of obstetric and gynecology   acog    article on pharmacotherapy within
the last two decade for treatment of hyperglycemia in gdm be review with emphasis on the recent
publication and recommendation  
3   historical aspect of gestational diabete
recognition of diabetes complicate pregnancy date back to 1873   6    in 1910   it be propose
that patient with gestational glycosuria be group into two category   namely   pregnant woman
suffer from true and persistent glycosuria and pregnant woman who pass sugar in their urine
only when their diet contain a large amount of sugar or starch   7    subsequently   in a series of
468 pregnant woman   5 be document with glycosuria with only one who be know to have
pre pregnancy diabete   8    the author suggest that in case where glycosuria occur during
pregnancy   true diabetes might be   about to manifest itself    from these early case   it be recognize
that there be a difference between diabetes diagnose prior to pregnancy and diabete diagnose
during pregnancy  
due to recognition of the possibility of diabete affect a pregnancy   study be conduct to
understand the effect of pregnancy on carbohydrate metabolism   the adverse effect of pregnancy on
carbohydrate metabolism be first document in 1946   9    hoet from belgium perform animal
experiment to study carbohydrate metabolism during pregnancy   10    the harmful effect of gdm
on pregnancy outcome be subsequently report   in 1946   while report on the effect of
hyperglycemia during pregnancy   the author document the finding that fetal death can occur even
before the woman have symptom of diabetes   11    subsequently   in 1959   the association of maternal
pre diabete with fetal macrosomia be publish in italy   12    two year later   o sullivan describe
gdm as   unsuspected and asymptomatic   diabete   which be elicit in response to a glucose tolerance
test during pregnancy   13    at that time   the incidence of gdm be report to be 1 in 116   13   
due to the recognition of the complication associate with gdm   a need for accurate and timely
diagnosis be realize   14 15    in 1924   a 50 g glucose load be administer to a pregnant patient with
history of glycosuria   to determine if she have glucose intolerance   16    the oral glucose tolerance test
  gtt   be describe in 1932   in search of an ideal glucose screen   an intravenous glucose tolerance test
and a prednisone glucose tolerance test be study   17 18    in 1961   o sullivan screen all pregnant
patient with a 50 g oral glucose load and when the one hour venous blood sugar be   130 mg dl  
the patient be consider screen positive   at that time   patient be also classify as screen positive
if the patient have a family history of diabetes   a prior fetal or neonatal death   congenital fetal anomaly  
prematurity   toxemia in two or more pregnancy   or a history of a prior baby that weigh 9 pound
or great   patient screen as positive be administer a three hour gtt   13   
by 1985   glucose screening be routinely be use in patient consider to be at   high risk   for
gdm   19    due to the vary definition   the report incidence of gdm range from 0 31   to 18   
this lead to the suggestion of use similar screening criterion by all center   to help well understand
the condition and its impact on pregnancy  
4   antenatal glucose screen
various organization attempt to establish population base protocol to diagnose gdm   20   
in 1999   the who recommend a screening test of a 75 g anhydrous glucose load   follow an
overnight fast for 8 14 h   between 24 and 28 week   gestation   the protocol suggest by
national and international organization such as the iadpsg   american diabetes association   ada   
and united kingdom base national institute for health and care excellence   nice   and canada
be recently review   21    both a single step and a two step screening process during pregnancy
have be describe   base on the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome   hapo   study

the iadpsg recommend a single step 2 h glucose tolerance test   after an overnight fast   a 75 g
glucose load be administer   the fast 1 h and 2 h plasma glucose level be check  
despite the ada endorse the one step 75 g glucose load gtt in 2011 base on the iadpsg
criterion   the national institute of health in the usa recommend the two step screen for gdm  
which have be adopt by the american college of obstetric and gynecology   acog    22 23   
in the two step approach   woman first undergo a 1 h 50 g glucose screen   and if it be abnormal   a 3 h gtt
with a 100 g glucose load be perform   if result be abnormal on the 3 h gtt   the patient be diagnose
with gdm   base on the one step iadpsg screening criterion   17 8   of pregnant patient in the usa
would test positive for gdm   which would nearly double the incidence of gdm in the usa   24   
the acog and other organization in the usa have not adopt the one step process due to a lack of
evidence of impact on the pregnancy outcome   the two step testing at 24 28 week   gestation start
with an initial screen in a non fast state   with an oral 50 g glucose load follow by a 1 h plasma
glucose level   the cutoff value for the 1 h glucose screen be 130 to 140 mg dl   screen positive woman
undergo the 3 h oral gtt   follow an overnight fast   a 100 g oral glucose load be administer  
plasma glucose level be check in the fast state and at 1 h   2 h   and 3 h follow the glucose
load   22    detail of the different screening protocol be document in table 1

5   pathophysiology of gestational diabetes
claes hellerström have be credit for the early work start in 1963 on pancreatic change
during pregnancy and lactation in a mouse model   25 28    insulin requirement physiologically increase
during pregnancy   the increase in insulin demand be due to increase maternal caloric intake   maternal
weight gain   presence of the placental hormone such as placental growth hormone   and placental
lactogen   as well as increase prolactin and growth hormone production   as the pregnancy advance  
the pancreatic β cell mass increase to keep up with the demand for increase insulin   failure of
the β cell expansion with a relative inadequate rise in insulin secretion lead to gdm  
maternal glucose be transport across the placenta to the fetus   and this delivery depend
on the concentration gradient between the fetus and the maternal glucose level   in the later part
of pregnancy   the fetus divert an increase amount of maternal glucose towards itself   which lead to

in conjunction with diet   woman should be advise to write down their meal with their blood glucose
value to help they identify food that may contribute to postprandial hyperglycemia  
there be a variety of dietary approach that have be describe in the literature  
include calorie restrict diet   low glycemic index diet   the dash diet   dietary approach
to stop hypertension    low carbohydrate diet   and low unsaturated fat diet   high fiber diet  
and soy base diet   most of the dietary study in pregnancy be report to be of low quality
evidence   29    acog reference a 1993 study suggest that the daily calorie allotment for gestational
diabetic be distribute by percentage between the macronutrient with 40   from carbohydrate  
20   protein   and 40   fat   22    however   the ada s 2017 review on diabetes care recommend similar
dietary guidance for gestational diabetic to woman with pre exist diabetes   fat consumption
guideline   cite from the institute of medicine   state that 20 35   of calorie should be from fat  
high quality complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index be prefer since they may
help reduce the need for insulin as well as decrease postprandial hyperglycemia   30    high protein
diet have not be demonstrate to improve health or glycemic control   and some study suggest
that excessive protein intake be associate with low fetal birthweight   30    the ada recommend
daily protein requirement of 1 1 5 g kg or 15 20   of consume calorie   base on the above
resource   dietary education should emphasize a balanced diet with portion control   healthy fat  
complex carbohydrate   and 20   protein  
9   physical activity
exercise and physical activity be support and encourage during pregnancy   include in
woman with gdm   moderate exercise during pregnancy have many beneficial effect include low
risk for development of gdm   low likelihood of large for gestational age neonate   and be
associate with low hypertensive disorder and preterm birth   without an increase in fetal growth
restriction   31 32    additionally   lifestyle change during pregnancy have an influence on the postpartum
period by lower the risk of postpartum depression   33    current recommendation be for 30 min of
moderate intensity exercise   5 day a week   when unable to perform moderate exercise   woman may
consider light exercise such as post meal walk for 10 15 min   which can have a beneficial impact on
blood sugar control   pregnant woman should avoid high impact activity since they could result in
abdominal trauma  
10   pharmacotherapy for management of gestational diabetes
in up to 15 30   of patient with gdm   despite recommend diet and lifestyle modification  
blood glucose control be inadequate   and pharmacotherapy be require   34    there be no well study
protocol to determine the optimal time to initiate pharmacotherapy for glycemic control   typically  
after a period of 10 14 day of dietary and lifestyle modification   if hyperglycemia persist through
the day   pharmacotherapy should be consider   base on a multicenter randomize trial by
the nichd   if the majority of fasting or postprandial blood glucose measurement be elevate or if
there be suspicion of hyperglycemia with a random blood glucose level of   160 mg dl or a fast level
of   95 mg dl   medication should be initiate   35   
insulin as well as oral medication have be use for the management of hyperglycemia in
gdm patient   during pregnancy   insulin have the safe profile   the oral agent that have be
study include sulfonylurea such as glyburide   also know as glibenclamide    as well as metformin  
in the usa   both the ada and acog recommend insulin as the first line for control of hyperglycemia
in patient with gdm   insulin be a large molecule and do not cross the placenta   metformin and
glyburide have be show to cross the placenta and into the fetus  
11   insulin regimen
in patient that require insulin   the dose and timing of administration depend on the patient s
body weight   gestational age   and the time of day at which hyperglycemia be occur   once initiate

insulin dose be adjust frequently throughout the pregnancy base on blood glucose result  
symptomatic hypoglycemia   physical activity   dietary consumption   infection   and compliance  
insulin be discover in 1922   in 1946   the intermediate act nph insulin be introduce   for a
long period of time   nph be be use   since then   research in different type of available insulin have
evolve significantly   the insulin analog that be currently available include rapidly act analog  
such as aspart   novolog   and lispro   humalog    short act regular insulin   intermediate acting nph
insulin   or long act insulin analog such as glargine   lantus   and detemir   levemir    in gdm  
short act insulin be report to increase the possibility of hypoglycemia and may cause fluctuation
in glycemic control   recent experience with aspart have be reassure   while lispro have be associate
with high birth weight and increase rate of large for gestational age neonate   36    for intermediateand long act insulin   randomize trial compare detemir to nph reveal no difference between
the two in regard to glucose control and perinatal outcome   detemir have be associate with a low
incidence of hypoglycemia in the non pregnant diabetic   37   
two main approach to prescribing insulin be base on the specific timing of recurrent
hyperglycemia   insulin can be administer throughout the day in divide dose or be give as a single
daily dose depend on the timing of hyperglycemia   in woman experience hyperglycemia only in
the morning fast state   intermediate insulin   such as nph   or detemir should be administer at
bedtime   as a single dose   in woman experience postprandial hyperglycemia follow specific meal
only   rapid act insulin should be consider prior to the meal   woman experience hyperglycemia
throughout the day should be manage with a combination of intermediate   or long act and
short act insulin   with the total daily dose of insulin of 0 7 1 0 unit kg divide into rapid acting
insulin give before meal and intermediate   or long act insulin in the morning or at bedtime   22   
when prescribe insulin   close blood glucose monitoring be need to try to avoid period of
hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia   patient be advise to bring their self monitor blood glucose log
to the office so the provider can determine if change in the insulin regiman be need  
12   oral hypoglycemic agent
oral medication have not be adequately study for possible long term effect on neonatal
outcome   and therefore they be not recommend as the first choice in treatment for persistent
hyperglycemia in gdm patient   these be also report to fail in control hyperglycemia in about
a quarter of woman with gdm   in instance where patient be unable to get insulin   or refuse insulin  
oral medication may be prescribe   when compare the two oral agent   metformin appear to
be safe than glyburide   glyburide have be associate with neonatal hypoglycemia and high
birth weight   which can increase the risk for shoulder dystocia and need for cesarean delivery   38 39   
additionally   glyburide be demonstrate to be present in umbilical cord blood sample in concentration
that be 50 70   those of maternal level which can lead to neonatal hypoglycemia   38    even though
metformin be state to have a low risk of neonatal hypoglycemia   the umbilical cord blood level of
metformin be report to be similar to or high than maternal level   34   
metformin dose start at 500 mg orally each night or 500 mg twice daily base on glycemic control  
maximum total daily dose be 2500 3000 mg during pregnancy   which be high than in the non pregnant
state   glyburide be start at 2 5 mg daily or every 12 h and gradually increase to a maximum of 10 mg
twice daily   base on glycemic control   22    in pregnancy   the serum concentration of glyburide rise
about 30 60 min after oral administration and peak in 2 3 h   with the peak concentration coincide
with the peak of blood glucose follow a meal   since glyburide peak at 2 3 h after administration  
high blood glucose value may be observe when check 1 or 2 h follow a meal   with a decrease
subsequent to that   this may lead to increase the glyburide dose but with a negative subsequent
effect of hypoglycemia since the peak activity be 2 3 h follow a meal   40    when optimal glucose
control on oral agent can not be achieve   the option of insulin should be re address with the patient

13   maternal and fetal complication
gestational diabete have a strong impact on maternal and fetal outcome   woman with gdm
be at increase risk for development of pre eclampsia and increase need for delivery by cesarean
section   much of this risk be relate to the degree of glycemic control during the pregnancy   with poor
glycemic control lead to high risk for poor obstetrical outcome   41    these risk include
obstetrical and neonatal complication such as preterm delivery   polyhydramnio   macrosomia  
shoulder dystocia   admission to the neonatal intensive care unit   neonatal respiratory distress syndrome  
fetal hypoglycemia   and hyperbilirubinemia   42    there be also an increase in the risk of stillbirth  
aside from pregnancy relate risk   woman diagnose with gestational diabete be at increase risk
of develop type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life  
14   antepartum surveillance
the need for fetal assessment be primarily base on maternal glycemic control   in woman
with good glycemic control on diet alone   fetal testing prior to 40 week   gestation be not indicate  
unless there be other indication   22    if the patient be not deliver by the estimate due date  
fetal testing can be perform weekly or twice weekly beginning at 40 week   gestation  
in woman require pharmacotherapy   antepartum fetal testing should be initiate by
32 week   gestation   consist of a biophysical profile and non stress test   these test be perform
twice weekly   similar to woman with pre existing diabete   and until delivery   43    presence of other
maternal co morbidity or development of hypertensive disorder may impact the frequency and
timing of antepartum testing   with some patient require fetal monitoring early than 32 week   22   
there be no clear consensus on ultrasound examination for fetal growth assessment   but it must be
perform at least once in the third trimester and close to delivery to assess fetal growth   in summary  
antepartum fetal monitoring be base on glycemic control   the use of medical therapy   and the presence
of additional risk factor   each institution should develop guideline that be feasible base on
the resource and facility at that institution  
15   delivery planning
acog publish guideline outline the timing of delivery in woman with gestational diabetes  
which be base on glycemic control   when gdm be well control with diet and exercise   delivery
should be consider start at 39 week   woman require medication and with good glucose
control be deliver between 39 and 39 6 7 week   gestation   there be less firm evidence on the timing
of delivery in woman with poorly control gdm   which can be consider between 37 and
38 6 7 week   gestation   take into account the presence of other risk factor   in woman with poor
glycemic control but reassure fetal testing   delivery in the preterm period be not recommend  
the presence of hypertensive disorder   other co morbidity   and non reassuring fetal testing will
alter the delivery time   22   
in woman with gdm and an estimate fetal weight of   4500 g on an ultrasound exam  
the recommendation for cesarean be not well establish   44    in gdm case with suspect
fetal macrosomia   along with be counsel regard the risk of possible shoulder dystocia with
vaginal delivery   benefit and risk of cesarean delivery should also be discuss   22 45    the timing
and anticipate route of delivery should be review with a patient during the third trimester  
16   intrapartum glucose management
during labor   woman who have require insulin for gdm may have their blood glucose level
check every hour or less frequently   depend on the antepartum requirement   woman that
be diet control can have less frequent blood glucose monitoring during labor   about every 4 h  
base on the finding of a recent randomize control trial of gdm patient in labor   blood sugar
level in the range of 60 120 mg dl be acceptable   in the trial   tight intrapartum blood glucose

control with a maternal blood glucose level of 70 100 mg dl be compare to more liberal control of
60 120 mg dl   it be find that there be no difference in neonatal glucose concentration between
the two group   46    base on the result of the study   when the blood glucose level during labor be
  120 mg dl   intrapartum insulin must be consider  
the starting dose or rate of intrapartum insulin be generally base on the severity of the elevated
blood glucose value   if an insulin infusion be start   hourly blood glucose level should be check
with the insulin rate adjust base on the hourly blood glucose level   insulin be infuse in a 5  
dextrose solution or normal saline 0 9    n   at 125 ml hour   the 5   glucose can be exchange with
n if the blood glucose level be persistently great than 180 mg dl   insulin infusion can be use for
woman undergo both vaginal and cesarean delivery   however   in patient undergo cesarean
section   a one time subcutaneous insulin injection can be consider to achieve euglycemia at the time
of delivery   this management be one of many option to ensure euglycemia in the mother prior to
delivery   there be a variety of other protocol that have be describe in the literature to optimize
intrapartum glucose control and the insulin protocol use may vary by institution  
17   postpartum
follow delivery   insulin and oral agent should be discontinue   in the immediate postpartum
period   a fast blood glucose level can be check to determine if the patient have persistent
hyperglycemia   a fast plasma glucose level of   126 mg dl or postprandial level of   200 mg dl
confirm persistent hyperglycemia   these patient be recommend to continue the diet modification
and lifestyle change and may need to be treat with pharmacological agent   insulin or glyburide can
be prescribe in the postpartum period even in breast feeding mother   without concern for neonatal
side effect   47   
in woman with gdm   the risk for subsequent development of type ii diabetes mellitus be estimate
to be 10 time the control population   at 16 15   when follow up for 10 year   some study show
the risk to be as high as 60    47 48    postpartum fast blood glucose often fail to identify patient
with impaired glucose tolerance and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus   the fifth international
workshop on gestational diabetes recommend woman complete a 75 g 2 h oral glucose tolerance test
at 6 to 12 week after delivery   44    a fast plasma glucose level of   100 mg dl and a 2 h post load
plasma glucose level of   140 mg dl be consider normal   when the fast plasma glucose level
be 100 125 mg dl or the 2 h post load glucose level be 140 199 mg dl   the patient be consider to
have impair glucose tolerance   when the fast plasma glucose level be   126 mg dl or the 2 h
post load level be   200 mg dl   the patient be diagnose with diabetes mellitus   recent datum support
perform the 2 h glucose tolerance test in the immediate postpartum period while the patient be
still hospitalize   49    this immediate postpartum glucose screening have not become standardized
yet and this approach should be individualize base on the patient population and resource in the
community   in conclusion   postpartum woman need to be remind of the importance of postpartum
follow up for the development of type ii diabetes mellitus  
there be limitation to this review   due to the vast amount of literature publish on the subject  
by various country   it be possible that some important publication may have not be include in
this review   the review be limit to the management of gestational diabete in the united states  
and this may differ in other country where the incidence of obesity may be low and resource
available to patient may be different  
18   discussion
base on the publish literature   we have review the history of gdm   screening option  
and management   with focus on the management option for persistent hyperglycemia   we report an
increase incidence of diabete and gdm in association with increase incidence in maternal obesity  
prevalence of gdm in the us have increase from   1   in 1961 to about 10    use the two step

about 18   in the we would qualify as having gdm   13 15    due to a lack of evidence of improvement in
pregnancy outcome base on the one step gtt   pregnant patient in the us continue to be screen at
24 28 week with the two step gtt as recommend by the acog   patient not previously diagnose
with diabetes mellitus but with risk factor for develop gdm be recommend to be screen
early in gestation   and if negative   the screen be repeat at 24 28 week  
patient with gdm be follow closely with self monitoring of blood glucose level   and lifestyle
change which include modification in diet and exercise   in those with persistent hyperglycemia despite
lifestyle change   treatment with medication must be consider   due to potential maternal and
perinatal side effect of the oral hypoglycemic agent   insulin be the preferred treatment   insulin regimen
consist of short    intermediate    and long act insulin   the type   dose   and timing of insulin be
determine by the timing and severity of hyperglycemia   and treatment be customize for each
patient   patient be follow closely   and the dose of insulin be adjust at regular interval base on
the patient s blood glucose level  
in patient unable to take insulin   oral hypoglycemic agent can be consider   metformin
be prefer over glyburide due to the risk of possible neonatal hypoglycemia associate with
maternal administration of glyburide   typically   the dose of oral medication be once or twice a day  
with increment in dose base on the degree   timing   and persistence of hyperglycemia  
in patient require medication for persistent hyperglycemia   due to increase perinatal risk  
fetal wellbeing test be initiate by 32 week   gestation   in patient that be well control gdm on
medication   delivery should be plan at 39 week and not early   however   in case of maternal
complication   poorly control hyperglycemia   or non assure fetal testing   the delivery may be
consider early  
due to the increase incidence of impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus in
patient with gdm   patient must be screen for diabete in the postpartum period use the 2 h gtt  
long term risk for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus be high   for early diagnosis of type
2 dm and to prevent long term effect of diabetes mellitus   regular follow up exam and testing   at a
minimum of every 1 3 year   be recommend  
among high risk patient that test positive for gdm on early gtt   some may indeed have type
2 diabetes mellitus that be previously undiagnose   the ideal screening test in this population
be not know as well as how early it should be administer   patient diagnose with gdm prior
to 20 week be frequently manage similar to those with type 2 diabetes mellitus   but datum on
the pregnancy outcome and perinatal outcome in this group have not be well study   future
study on pregnancy outcome in this population will become increasingly important   as the maternal
obesity rate continue to rise   whether obesity independently compound the pregnancy risk in

for healthcare provider worldwide   1 2    the mdgs be support by organization such as the
international federation of gynecology and obstetric   figo    which focus its effort on the
reduction of non communicable maternal disease   ncds   and exposure in pregnancy to improve the
future health of woman and their offspring   specifically   figo be target hyperglycemia   obesity  
hypertension   and poor nutrition in pregnancy to reduce the development of disease later in life  
such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus   t2d    this be important   as the goal of early intervention
be not only to improve future maternal health but also to reduce disease prevalence in subsequent
generation   2   
pregnancy be often describe as a   window   to future health   3    since the physiologic change that
occur during this time act as a natural   stress test   for the body   many woman seek medical care during

their pregnancy   which make this an opportune time for preventive healthcare guidance   in recent
year   there have also be a grow realization that the intrauterine environment   e g    the maternal
nutritional status   influence the health of offspring throughout their lifespan   4 5    the emerge field
of the developmental origin of health and disease   dohad   posit that intrauterine and early infant
environment have a permanent conditioning or programming effect on the body s metabolism and
health later in life  
one common physiological change that can occur during pregnancy be the development of
glucose intolerance cause hyperglycemia   this be refer to as gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   
the pathophysiology of gdm be not fully understand but have be link to hormonal imbalance
affect insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β cell dysfunction   6    it be estimate that one in every six
pregnancy worldwide be associate with hyperglycemia   84   of which be classify as gdm   2   
gdm be an important determinant of the development of t2d in both mother and their offspring  
and thus   achieve glycemic control during pregnancy may provide a window of opportunity to
prevent and lower the burden of t2d in many generation  
the goal of this review be to elaborate on how peripartum nutrition affect longstanding maternal
and neonatal outcome   as well as health risk that likely persist into future generation   we aim to
summarize current knowledge and datum on gdm   with a specific emphasis on screen   diagnosis  
and peripartum complication and preclinical model of the disease   understand risk factor and
improve diagnosis will allow early identification and intervention   with the goal of prevent
future complication  
2   gestational diabetes mellitus
gdm   define as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy   7    be a
common antepartum condition impact about 9 25   of pregnancy worldwide   8 9    with rate
fluctuate depend on study population and diagnostic criterion   gdm be characterize by impaired
glucose tolerance as a result of maternal pancreatic β cell dysfunction   result in the insufficiency of
insulin to regulate glucose homeostasis during pregnancy   10   
insulin   an anabolic hormone release by the β cell in the pancreas   modulate glucose homeostasis
by stimulate glucose uptake into peripheral tissue   inhibit glucose production by the liver  
and suppress store lipid release from the adipose tissue   insulin resistance be a state in which
normal concentration of insulin fail to achieve an appropriate biological response downstream of the
insulin receptor   as a result   the β cell have to release more insulin than usual to regulate maternal
blood glucose level   in a healthy pregnancy   a condition of progressive insulin resistance occur in the
mother   trigger by placental hormone to ensure the fetus receive adequate nutrient for healthy
growth and development   in order to maintain glucose homeostasis despite insulin resistance   the
maternal β cell compensate by increase total cell number   insulin synthesis   and insulin secretion   11   
however   when the maternal β cell be unable to adapt to the metabolic change accompany
pregnancy   hyperglycemia of gdm occur  
3   risk factor for gdm
3 1   modifiable risk factor
3 1 1   overweight   obesity   and pre pregnancy body mass index   bmi  
during pregnancy   maternal dyslipidemia be a physiological response that provide fuel and
nutrient for both the placenta and the develop fetus   12    it be not unusual to observe weight
gain in pregnancy   mark by deposition and hypertrophy of adipocyte in the maternal adipose
tissue   13    while pregnant mother be expect to gain about 30   of their gestational weight in body
fat   14    overweight and obesity be the most associated risk factor for gdm   15    pre pregnancy
bmi alone be an important risk factor for gdm   16    the world health organization   who   define
 
 
int   j   mol   sci   2020   21   5003
 
3 of 21
 
overweight and obesity as an abnormal or excessive fat accumulation base on bmi    25 kg m2 or
   30 kg m2    respectively   give the current epidemic of obesity and the increase rate of obesity
in child bear woman   it be estimate that there be 38 9 million overweight and 14 6 million
obese pregnant woman worldwide   17    for people who be overweight and obese   increase lipid
production lead to the accumulation of lipid   mainly triglyceride   in the adipose tissue and other
organ   such as the liver   hepatic insulin resistance be increase in obesity and be far exacerbate
by pregnancy   thus increase the risk of develop gdm   18    moreover   be overweight or
obese during pregnancy can increase the risk of adverse consequence such as metabolic disorder  
hypertension   19    premature delivery   20    and stillbirth   21 22    as well as other   23    for these
reason   obstetrician regularly assess the bmi and gestational weight gain of pregnant woman   24  
in order to prevent complication for both mother and child   the current prevention strategy to
manage body weight during pregnancy include nutritional therapy and improve dietary and lifestyle
habit   25 27   
3 1 2   metabolic syndrome and nutritional diet
the term metabolic syndrome be first use by the national cholesterol education program
adult treatment panel iii to describe the clustering occurrence of metabolic disorder such as
obesity   dyslipidemia   hypertension   and abnormal glucose metabolism under one common condition  
metabolic syndrome when accompany by a western style diet high in sweet   fat   and process
food   be know to increase the occurrence of gdm   28 32    in addition   vitamin d deficiency and high
dietary acid load may also contribute to the risk of gdm   33   
notably   the first line of prevention or treatment for metabolic syndrome be nutritional diet therapy  
which have be show to be beneficial in maintain glucose control and physiologic health   34 36   
nutritional therapy   such as high fiber and low glycemic index diet   have be show to improve
insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance   which may reduce the risk for gdm   37 42    recent literature
have also show the benefit of probiotic therapy in improve blood glucose level by target the gut
microbiota   43 45    finally   anti hyperglycemic medication   such as insulin therapy and metformin  
can be introduce when lifestyle modification alone be not sufficient to achieve glycemic control   46   
3 1 3   polycystic ovary syndrome   pcos  
gdm and polycystic ovary syndrome   pcos   be the most common endocrine disorder in
woman of reproductive age   pcos be a heterogeneous endocrine and metabolic disorder characterize
by chronic oligomenorrhea   47    hyperandrogenism   48    and insulin resistance   49    like gdm   pcos
be associate with insulin resistance and obesity   50    while the risk for gdm increase for woman with
pcos in the presence of other comorbiditie   such as obesity and increase maternal age   pcos per se
be not an independent risk factor for gdm   51 52    in a prevalence study in california   datum show that
pregnant woman with pco have more than a twofold risk for gdm compare with woman without
pcos or related symptom   53    indeed   the prevalence of pcos be high in woman with gdm than in
non diabetic woman   51    pco be often associate with metabolic syndrome   and common prevention
strategy include lifestyle modification   54 55   and pharmacological treatment   56   
3 1 4   pre eclampsia
pre eclampsia be a common hypertensive disorder that occur in 2 8   of all pregnancy
worldwide   57 58    like gdm   pre eclampsia be link to glucose intolerance   hyperglycemia   and
obesity   59    hyperglycemia be know to increase the risk of pre eclampsia   60 62    in subsequent
pregnancy   pre eclampsia be an independent risk factor for gdm   61   
3 1 5   additional modifiable risk factor for gdm
a few study have determine that prolong exposure to environmental psychological stress
be relate to maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy   which may increase the risk of gdm   63   
 
 
int   j   mol   sci   2020   21   5003
 
4 of 21
 
similarly   the use of antidepressant and psychotropic medication   smoke   and poor sleep hygiene
have also be show to be risk factor for gdm   64 66   
3 2   non modifiable risk factor
3 2 1   maternal age
maternal age be a common risk factor for gdm   study have show that maternal age above
25 30 year increase the risk of develop gdm   67 70    in a meta analysis study investigate
the relationship between maternal age and the risk of gdm   author identify a linear relationship
between the risk for gdm and increase maternal age   it be also indicate that for every successive
year after the age of 18   the risk for gdm increase by 7 90    12 74    and 6 52   in the general   asian  
and europid population   respectively   71   
3 2 2   gravidity and parity
increase gravidity   define as the number of time that a woman have be pregnant   and parity  
I e    the number of time that she have give birth   may represent an additional risk for gdm   69   
this elevated risk of develop gdm have be link to parity as low as two   67 72    the effect
of gravidity on the risk of gdm have be associate with increase age as well   since an increase
number of pregnancy be observe in woman with advanced maternal age   73   
3 2 3   ethnicity
several study have link gdm development with ethnicity   increase risk of gdm be see in
multiple ethnic and racial group   include hispanic   african american   and asian woman   73 74   
woman of korean   chinese   and filipino descent be more than twice as likely to develop gdm as
caucasian or african american woman   75    although the mechanism remain unclear   possible
explanation can arise from health predisposition   lifestyle   cultural factor   and socioeconomic
stressor   71 73    in regard to t2d study   south asians have be report to have reduce fat
metabolism   muscle fitness   insulin sensitivity   and insulin secretion   all of which support a high
tendency towards glucose intolerance   76 77    take ethnicity as a risk factor for gdm   it be therefore
important for health provider to recognize that certain ethnic group may benefit from special
preventive and culturally sensitive care   further   structural change   such as combat systemic
racism and bias be necessary to break down disparity associate with these preventable ncd  
3 2 4   genetic and family history of hyperglycemia
gdm be a multifactorial disease with both genetic and environmental influence   a family history
of diabetes be an important independent risk factor for the development of gdm   78    there be a
strong association between common t2d risk gene polymorphism and gdm   79    five of the most
identify gene in gdm be    1   transcription factor 7 like 2   tcfl7l2    80 81     2   melatonin receptor
1b   mtnr1b    82 83     3   cdk5 regulatory subunit associate protein 1 like 1   cdkal1    84 85   
  4   potassium voltage gate channel   kqt like subfamily   member 1   kcnq1    86 87    and   5   insulin
receptor substrate 1   irs1    88 89    the most recent and comprehensive search in the genetic and
epigenetic etiology of gdm have be review elsewhere   90 91    these epigenetic modification
may result in maternal and paternal transgenerational inheritance of obesity and glucose intolerance in
the offspring   92 94    moreover   the type of genetic variation and the mechanism of epigenetic may
contribute to genotypic and phenotypic characteristic in different ethnicity   95 96    for example  
study that explore the relationship between ethnicity and gdm reveal that asian woman have
the high gdm incidence   97 98    the variability in the association of genetic polymorphism and
risk of gdm have be attribute to ethnicity or population difference   thus   there be a need to perform
population dependent study on the effect of genetic polymorphism on the risk of gdm   99 100

3 3   socioeconomic and geographic risk factor
3 3 1   climate and geographical location
the who recognize that vary climate condition from extreme winter temperature to
summer temperature have an impact on human health   there be increase evidence show the
influence of temperature on physiologic mechanism such as the regulation of fat and lipid   101 102   
energy expenditure   hormonal homeostasis   103    myocardial infarction   104    and mortality   105   
climate also appear to have an effect on gdm   in region with seasonal weather change there be a
high prevalence of gdm than in more temperate region of the world   106   
3 3 2   education and socio economic status
base on observational study   many woman diagnose with gdm be unaware of the risk factor
and complication of their diagnosis   107 109    a study in finland report that there be an inverse
relationship between socioeconomic status and gdm   110    this be support by finding that patient
who be uninsured and underinsured receive less preventive healthcare   with some receive little or
no healthcare at all   111 112    to improve the efficacy of gdm treatment   promote health education
combine with government support to patient be an important component of prenatal care   113   
several strategy show to be beneficial in promote awareness of gdm and improve pregnancy
outcome include the use of web base education   97   and or of individual or group educational
session with a healthcare provider or a dietician   114 116   
3 4   screening and diagnosis
3 4 1   laboratory evaluation
to fully address the increase prevalence of gdm worldwide   routine screening for gdm during
prenatal care be necessary   however   only few country routinely test pregnant woman universally  
in the united states   the american college of obstetrician and gynecologist   acog   recommend all
pregnant woman be test in the mid trimester   between 24 and 28 week of gestation    117    in some
country   testing be complete base on the risk assessment do by the obstetrician gynecologist  
risk be categorize by doctor as low   average   or very high   low risk individual be those whose
age be below 25 year   with normal pre pregnancy weight   member of an ethnic group with a low
prevalence of diabetes   no know diabete in first degree relative   no history of abnormal glucose
tolerance   and no history of poor obstetric outcome  
although there be no international   standardized consensus on the screening test to be use  
the oral glucose tolerance test   ogtt   be commonly utilize   118 119    there be two current approach
for test gdm   in the one step approach   a single 75 g ogtt be conduct   while in the two step
approach   an initial screening use a 50 g oral glucose challenge test   ogct   be perform   if the result
of this test show a glucose value equal or great than 7 7 mmol l   130 140 mg dl    117    the pregnant
woman analyze should undergo a confirmatory 100 g ogtt several day after the ogct   120 122   
table 1 below show the comparison between the one step approach and the two step approach  
numerous study have evaluate these screening modality   one study compare the prevalence
and pregnancy outcome of thai gdm patient screen use the one step   75 g ogtt and the
two step approach   the result show a very high prevalence of gdm when the one step approach
be utilize   however   there be no clear evidence of well performance of this test   this high
prevalence see use the one step approach be associate with the use of a low threshold for
diagnosis   which thus lead to an increase sensitivity   123    a high sensitivity may result in an
increase number of false positive and overdiagnosis and treatment   with increase risk of unnecessary
intervention   high cost   and decrease maternal satisfaction with testing and prenatal care   125   
the two testing approach present advantage and disadvantage   while the one step approach have a
low economic burden and a low threshold   allow for the early diagnosis of milder disease and

possible early prevention of complication in the mother and baby   124 126    the two step approach be
less convenient economically and require more time for diagnosis   though it still provide diagnostic
efficacy   127

3 4 2   criterion for gdm diagnosis
the selection criterion for the diagnosis of gdm be controversial because of issue in determine
the standard reference interval for gdm diagnosis   the standardization of global criterion be a challenge
because gdm be influence by genetic   ethnicity   and socioeconomic and societal factor   the follow
health professional and study group have propose their own diagnostic criterion   american diabete

3 5   complication
gdm be characterize by hyperglycemia diagnose during pregnancy   cause by or compound
with underlying mechanism such as genetic predisposition   insulin resistance   and chronic
inflammation   although the condition be usually transient   it be a risk factor for the development of t2d
 
 
int   j   mol   sci   2020   21   5003

later in life and may also lead to long term adverse effect in both mother and offspring   this session
enumerate the possible metabolic and physical change result from gdm development  
3 5 1   maternal complication
in gdm   hyperglycemia may damage endothelial cell   which can result in vascular
dysfunction   138   associate with hypertension   139    because of this   it be have be suggest
that gdm increase the incidence of hypertension during pregnancy and the postpartum period   140   
both diabete and hypertension be risk factor for the development of pre eclampsia   a disorder which
affect between 3   and 5   of pregnancy worldwide and be characterize by high blood pressure and
proteinuria   141 142   
although hyperglycemia during pregnancy usually resolve after delivery   prolong insulin
resistance and β cell dysfunction can also be observe in gdm patient   persist beyond
pregnancy   143    because of this   woman with previously diagnose gdm have an increase
risk of develop t2d later in life   144 148    with a risk high as 50    149    also   woman who
have develop gdm in previous pregnancy may experience a recurrence of gdm in subsequent
pregnancy   150 151    for this reason   all woman who carry a diagnosis of gdm should have a 2 h
glucose tolerance test at their 6 week post partum visit   117   
3 5 2   fetal complication
the develop fetus have a limited ability to produce glucose   therefore   it derive most of its
glucose from maternal blood   maternal glucose cross the placenta   while maternal insulin do
not   as a result   accord to the modify pedersen s hypothesis   if maternal glucose level be
high and uncontrolle   the excess glucose transport through the placenta induce increase fetal
insulin production regardless of glucose stimulation   152    this be support by the observe increase
in the expression of glucose transport protein   glut   in the placenta in pregnancy affect by
insulin dependent diabete mellitus   153    insulin can also stimulate mtor   a potent regulator of cell
growth   154    an increase of placental mtor activity due to increase maternal insulin result in
increase cell proliferation and nutrient transport to the fetus via system a and system l amino acid
transporter in the placenta   155 156    hart et al   review the role of mtor as a nutrient sensor in
fetal growth   157   
because of the aforementione factor see in gdm   maternal hyperglycemia and
hyperinsulinemia can lead to similar change in the fetus   158 159    which can contribute to neonatal
adiposity   160    excess nutrient storage result in an increase in neonatal size at birth   or macrosomia  
between 15   and 45   of gdm pregnancy result in macrosomic infant   152    with the bulk of
adiposity concentrate around the fetal abdoman and shoulder   increase the risk for shoulder
dystocia and birth trauma   161    the presence of gdm   couple with other risk factor like hypertension
and obesity during pregnancy   may also lead to preterm labor and birth   162    a prevalence that reach
about 10 6   worldwide   163   
3 5 3   neonatal complication
neonatal complication include possible asphyxia   hypoglycemia   kernicteru and jaundice  
bacterial infection   neonatal respiratory distress syndrome   nrd    and birth trauma   include
shoulder dystocia and injury to the brachial plexus   152    neonatal hypoglycemia occur as a result
of the abrupt cessation of the maternal source of glucose at birth   164    this be exacerbate by
fetal hyperinsulinemia due to gdm and require extensive treatment and care if the hypoglycemia
persist   165   
3 5 4   childhood and adulthood complication
the association between gdm and hyperglycemia in the offspring be well establish   in the
united states   the study of the pima indians provide initial evidence that maternal hyperglycemia
 
 
int   j   mol   sci   2020   21   5003
 
8 of 21
 
could lead to adult disease in the offspring   several epidemiological study demonstrate the pima
indian population as have the high prevalence of t2d among child and adult   166    indeed  
the offspring of diabetic mother be more often prone to obesity   hypertension   and dyslipidemia
later in life   167    the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome   hapo   study in 10 country
reveal that maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy be significantly associate with an increase in
hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in the offspring in adulthood   168    marker for insulin resistance  
like homa ir   bmi   waist circumference   and triglyceride level   be also at high level in gdm
offspring than in those bear to normoglycemic mother   169 170    presumably   the development of
insulin resistance increase the risk of the offspring to develop diabete   with approximately 20   of
gdm offspre develop t2d and prediabete by age 22   171 172   
the increase development of obesity observe in the offspring of mother with gdm be also
associate with an increase risk of metabolic disorder include cardiovascular disease and insulin
resistance   173    child bear to gdm mother be observe to have significantly high blood
pressure and adiposity   along with hyperglycemia and bmi   174 175    as a result of increase
cardiovascular risk   gdm offspring be more likely to develop cardiac arrhythmias and be hospitalize
for cardiovascular disease   cvds    176    gdm offspring be also 29   more likely to develop early onset
cvds such as heart failure   hypertensive disease   deep vein thrombosis   and pulmonary embolism   177   
all of these study point to the influence of the environment in utero in the programming of metabolic
disease in the offspring   this be an important factor to consider   because overnutrition   physical
inactivity   and or genetic factor alone be not sufficient to explain the current epidemic increase in t2d
and obesity   monterio et al   review the mechanism of fetal programming in gdm elsewhere   178   
4   preclinical model of gdm
to stop the vicious cycle of diabetes   we need a great understanding of the pathophysiology of
gdm and the mechanism of fetal programming induce by gdm   as previously mention   this
be an essential endeavor   because gdm confer short   and long term health risk for the mother and
the fetus   with potential long term health consequence in childhood and adulthood   179    however  
establish causality be difficult in human and epidemiological study   which be often complicated
by confound multiple factor   therefore   experimental animal model be critical to study the
underlie mechanism and pathophysiology of gdm   method for generate animal model of gdm
be diverse and include the surgical removal of all or part of the pancreas   the use of pharmacological
agent   diet induce strategy   and genetic model   180   
4 1   surgical model
surgical model include partial or total pancreatectomy   directly reduce the availability of
pancreatic β cell and dramatically impair glucose homeostasis   180    one study perform
pancreatectomy in a rat model to reduce the pancreatic mass by 95    result in uterine dysfunction
in pregnant rat with mild gdm   181    while pancreatectomy be successful in induce gdm  
it be perform prior to pregnancy   which do not accurately reflect the development of human
gdm   pancreatectomy have also be show to induce hyperglycemia and diabete in healthy baboon  
however   such model be rarely use in the context of pregnancy   182    while the surgical removal
of the pancrea may induce maternal diabetes during pregnancy   it be an invasive and nonspecific
procedure   as it remove both the endocrine and the exocrine tissue of the pancreas   180    this may
result in potential effect not relate to gdm  
4 2   pharmacological model
pharmacological agent   include streptozotocin   stz   and alloxan   have be use to selectively
destroy the pancreatic β cell and impair β cell function   183 184    chemical agent offer a relatively

time of gestation at which the drug be administer   while rodent be more commonly use as
model for chemical induce diabetes study   stz have be use in nonhuman primate to study
the effect of maternal diabete on the offspring   185    in female rhesus monkey   stz treatment
induce hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance   185 186    the treat animal be also find to have
large placenta and neonate   as well as a high incidence of stillbirth   186    while both surgical and
chemical animal model have be use to reproduce gdm   neither be able to accurately simulate the
condition of human gdm   pancreatectomy and the use of stz and alloxan permanently remove the
endocrine function of the pancreas   reduce insulin and result in a permanent state of diabetes  
this be unlike gdm in human   usually a transitory disease that develop as a consequence of maternal
insulin resistance   compound by increase amount of human placental lactogen throughout
pregnancy and the inability of the maternal pancreatic β cell to adapt   180    it be also important to
acknowledge that there can be fundamental similarity and important difference between rodent
and human regard islet biology   for example   there be still a debate on β cell compensation
during pregnancy in rodent model vs   human   187    because limit human autopsy study do not
consistently support the mechanism observe in rodent  
4 3   diet induce model
diet induce model of gdm include high fat feeding in animal model to induce insulin
resistance and diabete   a study use a high fat diet   hfd   demonstrate that in the non pregnant
state   female rat   while obese   display normal glucose clearance   after successful mating with
control male   pregnant female on hfd display hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance   188   
in another study   pregnant female rat be administer continuous glucose infusion during the
last week of gestation   induce hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia   189    the offspring bear to
these female have phenotype resemble those of child bear to mother with gdm   while a gdm
animal model involve obesity may represent actual risk factor for human gdm   these model do
not consider the genetic and social factor contribute to the development of the disease  
4 4   genetic model
genetic model have be use to induce gdm in animal   the db db mouse model of leptin
deficiency be currently the most widely use model of t2d   normally   db    female animal present
a normal glucose homeostasis phenotype   however   during pregnancy   they develop spontaneous
gdm   and pup display characteristic similar to those of infant of gdm mother   190    for example  
the offspring of db    dam with gdm exhibit obesity and insulin resistance in the liver   another
model that have be describe be the prolactin receptor deficient   prlr       mouse   while prlr     female
be unable to carry a pregnancy to full term   prl     dam exhibit hyperglycemia and failure to
increase β cell mass and proliferation during pregnancy   a necessary event to maintain euglycemia   191   
in the non pregnant state   these female mouse present with euglycemia and decrease β cell mass  
other genetic model that have investigate transcription factor and different key signaling pathway
to induce gdm be discuss elsewhere   180 192 193    genetic model provide an opportunity to
study the underlie mechanism involve in the pathogenesis of gdm   unfortunately   conclusion
may be limit   as they be often base on single gene mutation   which do not accurately mimic the
polygenetic and environmental factor contribute to human gdm  
4 5   fetal programming model
several novel model of gdm have be generate by use the first generation offspring   f1  
of dams   f0   from various intrauterine programming procedure   in a study use a rat model   stz  
a toxin that promote pancreatic β cell demise   be administer to f0 generation female pup to
induce diabete   194    after successful mating with nondiabetic male   the female f1 pup be use to
study gdm during pregnancy   they find that non pregnant f1 pup be euglycemic but develop
hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia during pregnancy   this suggest that exposure to a diabetic

intrauterine environment may set up female offspring to develop gdm during pregnancy   in another
study   a uteroplacental insufficiency rat model be use to generate intrauterine growth restrict
  iugr   offspring   195    after successful breeding of the iugr female offspring to normal male  
pregnant female demonstrate glucose impairment and insulin resistance   the offspring of these
female rat exhibit increase body weight   insulin resistance   and impaired glucose clearance  
eventually develop diabete   in another mouse model   researcher use the f1 offspring bear to
dams feed a low protein   lp   diet during gestation and lactation   the f1 female develop glucose
intolerance and reduce β cell proliferation during pregnancy   196    these model demonstrate that
exposure to gdm or glucose intolerance during gestation increase the susceptibility of the offspring
  f1   to develop gdm  
animal model have also be use to study the consequence of gdm on the health of the
offspre   offspring bear to mother with gdm be at increase risk for obesity   glucose intolerance  
and diabete   179    in the previously mention study by gauguier et al    in which gdm be induce
in female rat by continuous glucose infusion administer during the last week of pregnancy   189 197   
female offspring demonstrate glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion   when these female
offspring be mate with control male   the newborn offspring present with hyperglycemia  
hyperinsulinemia   and increase body weight   which persist into adulthood   these study suggest
that intrauterine exposure to maternal diabete may affect the health of more than one generation  
in the intrauterine programming model of maternal gestational diabete in rat by boloker et al   
the offspring develop glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion   which worsen with
age   195    the effect of maternal high fat diet on the health of the offspring have also be study in
nonhuman primate   in female japanese macaque   maternal high fat diet be show to increase liver
triglyceride and increase the risk of develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the offspring   198 199   
these study provide evidence that there be last effect of maternal gestational diabete on the
health of the offspring  
gdm be a complex disease with genetic   environmental   and epigenetic risk factor   therefore  
it be unlikely that a single animal model will accurately represent human gdm   a realistic model may
include animal model with multiple etiology present by gdm   which will likely include both
genetic and environmental factor   furthermore   while large animal and nonhuman primate may
be more similar to human physiologically   study use these animal model remain more limited
compare to those on mouse and rat model   due to feasibility and cost  
nevertheless   animal model have advance the understanding of maternal gestational diabetes
beyond clinical observation alone   furthermore   they may provide a valuable mean to study
intervention strategy target gdm in pregnant woman  
5   conclude remark
the high prevalence of gdm be a major obstacle to achieve improve maternal and child
health   while gdm be a transient condition   its sequalae be lifelong   and gdm research should
be a public health priority   study discuss in this review underscore the gravity of gdm and
challenge to its management   include identify and overcome risk factor   accurate diagnosis

abstract
aim introduction   pregnant woman with gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be at
a high risk of adverse pregnancy outcome   the aim of the present study be to estimate the pool prevalence of gdm in mainland china accord to international association of diabetes and pregnancy study group criterion  
material and method   we carry out a systematic review by search both english and chinese literature database   random effect model be use to summarize
the prevalence of gdm in mainland china   subgroup and sensitivity analysis be carry
out to address heterogeneity   publication bias be evaluate use egger s test  
result   a total of 25 paper be include in the meta analysis   involve 79 064 chinese participant   the total incidence of gdm in mainland china be 14 8    95   confidence interval 12 8 16 7     subgroup analysis show that the age   bodyweight and
family history of diabetes mellitus could significantly increase the incidence of gdm  
conclusion   to the good of our knowledge   this systematic review be the first to estimate the pool prevalence of gdm among woman in mainland china accord to
international association of diabetes and pregnancy study group criteria   the result of
our systematic review suggest a high prevalence of gdm in mainland china   indicate
that this country might have the large number of gdm patient worldwide  
 
introduction
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be deﬁne as carbohydrate
intolerance result in hyperglycemia with ﬁrst onset or detection during pregnancy   gdm be seriously harmful to both the
woman and the fetus   pregnant woman and puerperae be prone
to complication of gestational hypertensive disease   polyhydramnio   premature rupture of fetal membrane   infection and premature birth   in severe case   ketoacidosis can occur   and
puerperae might have long term postpartum diabetes1 2   in addition   the fetus be prone to spontaneous abortion   malformation
and hypoxia   in severe case   intrauterine death can occur   hyperglycemia tend to cause fetal macrosomia   the chance of dystocia
at parturition be increase   and the newborn be prone to neonatal
respiratory distress syndrome   hypoglycemia and other complication after birth   include death in severe instances3  
in 2008   the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome
  hapo   study   which involve multiple country   show that

at 24 32 week of gestation   a high blood glucose level in the
75 g oral glucose tolerance test   ogtt   indicate a great risk
of adverse gestational outcome   indeed   even with a normal
blood glucose level   the risk of have an adverse outcome for
both mother and baby be great with an increase in blood glucose level   whereas signiﬁcant threshold be not observe for
most comorbiditie   base on that study   the international
association of diabetes and pregnancy study group
  iadpsg   propose new gdm diagnostic criterion in 2010  
boundary blood glucose level for fast   1 and 2 h after oral
glucose of 5 1   10 0 and 8 5 mmol l   respectively   by 75 g
ogtt   if any one of these three value reach or exceed the
boundary level   the patient should be diagnose with gdm4  
the publication of this diagnostic standard have a   milestone  
signiﬁcance   in 2011   the american diabetes association
  ada   recommend the iadpsg criterion be adopt as
gdm diagnostic criterion   and in august 2013   the world
health organization   who   use the hapo study result as
an important reference to develop new gdm diagnostic

criteria5   in 2014   the ada once again note that although the
new diagnostic criterion would increase healthcare cost   they
might also reduce the incidence of adverse gestation event  
especially for pregnant woman with slightly high blood glucose
level   in october 2015   the international federation of gynecology and obstetric publish a practical guide to gdm  
which also utilize the iadpsg criterion to diagnose gdm6  
as a result of economic development and improvement in
living standard   together with increase attention to gdm
screen   an increase have be observe in the incidence of
gdm   china have a high incidence of diabetes   and the increase
in gdm incidence in china be also alarm   furthermore  
china encompass a vast territory   and have a large population
with considerable difference in region   ethnicity   diet and
living habit   and these factor lead to difference in the incidence of gdm report in various region   for example   study have find that even if the iadpsg diagnostic criterion be
apply   the incidence of gdm in mainland china ﬂuctuate
between 5 12   and 33 3 7 8   as there be currently no systematic
analysis of the incidence of gdm in china   the present study
aim to explore the incidence of gdm among pregnant
woman in mainland china   and the impact of relevant factor
on gdm incidence through a systematic meta analysis

discussion
as early as 1964   o sullivan and mahan32 suggest screen
for high risk pregnant woman and   for the ﬁrst time   propose
diagnostic criterion for gdm   whereby patient should be diagnose with gdm when blood glucose level be equal to or
great than boundary value for fast   1   2 and 3 h after oral
glucose of 5 0   9 2   8 1 and 7 0 mmol l   respectively   accord
to the 100 g ogtt   in 1973   o sullivan et al33 propose a 50 g ogtt   if the blood glucose level be   7 2 mmol l 1 h after
glucose load   then the 100 g ogtt be carry out   the result
of a number of subsequent study show that for gdm
screen   it be most suitable to use 7 8 mmol l as the boundary value for a blood glucose level at 1 h after glucose load   a
value that be still use today   in 1979   the national diabetes
data group modiﬁe the diagnostic criterion of gdm base on
o sullivan s standard34   in this case   the patient should be diagnose with gdm when plasma glucose level be   2 boundary
point of the value for fast   1   2 and 3 h after glucose load
 
ª 2018 the author   journal of diabetes investigation publish by aasd and john wiley    son australia   ltd
 
of 5 8   10 6   9 2 and 8 1 mmol l   respectively   in 1982   carpenter35 recommend that the plasma glucose boundary value
for fast   1   2 and 3 h after take glucose be 5 3   10 0   8 6
and 7 8 mmol l   respectively   with gdm diagnosis at level   2
boundary point   in 1998   this standard be recommend for
application by the ada   but the glucose load be change
from 100 to 75 g   and the 3 h blood glucose value be
remove   as guideline for the diagnosis and classiﬁcation of
diabete be issue by the who in 1965   in 1999   it recommend after three discussion that patient should be diagnose with gdm when fast plasma glucose be   7 0 mmol l
or 2 h blood glucose be 11 1 mmol l   although the ndgg  
ada and who standard have be use for many year   for
the past 50 year   the diagnostic method and standard for
gdm have be the subject of controversy   both the standard
propose by o sullivan and the later national diabetes datum
group or ada standard be all base on the risk of a pregnant
woman develop type 2 diabetes   but these standard lack
any consideration of gestational outcome   the who standard  
which directly evolve from the non pregnant standard   also
have shortcoming when it be directly apply to pregnancy   in
2010   the iadpsg propose a new standard for gdm diagnosis base on the hapo study   and in this same year   the ada

incidence of gdm in young woman be just 13 4    thus   the
incidence of gdm among old woman be approximately
twice that among young woman   as china s fertility policy
change   divorce and remarriage rate increase   and multiparous
woman might have more child due to the death of offspring
as a result of disease or accident   thus   the incidence of
advanced maternal age among pregnant woman will continue
to increase in china   apart from the factor of age   the incidence of gdm in woman with a family history of diabetes be
threefold as high as that of woman without a family history  
suggest that a family history of diabetes signiﬁcantly
increase the incidence of gdm   in addition   overweight or
obesity also show signiﬁcant impact on the incidence of
gdm   conversely   we find that the per capita economic level
of the 21 city include do not inﬂuence the incidence of
gdm   we suggest that this apparent lack of inﬂuence might
be relate to the mixed effect of diet   lifestyle   region and
many other factor  
china be a multi ethnic country   with the han nationality as
the main group   in the present study   the incidence of gdm
among woman of the kirgiz nationality of xinjiang be low
than that of the han nationality   but only one study be
include   in addition   some study have find the incidence of
gdm in multiparous woman to be high than that of woman
with a single pregnancy   again   the sample size be small   and
thus   further study be require  
the limitation of the present study be that the main datum
from the study include be from large scale comprehensive
hospital and specialist hospital   as only a few study be
multicenter   multilevel study   the datum lack result from
grass root hospital   furthermore   the study participant be
mainly from urban population   study on the prevalence of
gdm in pregnant woman in china s rural area be rare  
which will impact the calculation of the total prevalence of
gdm in mainland china   we hope that there will be more
epidemiological study on gdm in grass root hospital and in
rural population in the future  
to the good of our knowledge   the present systematic review
be the ﬁrst to estimate the pool prevalence of gdm among
woman in mainland china accord to iadpsg criterion   the
result of the present systematic review suggest that the total
incidence of gdm in mainland china be 14 8    indicate that
china might have the large number of gdm patient   therefore   more attention should be pay to the prevention and control of gdm

prevention of diabetes in woman with a history of
gestational diabetes   effect of metformin and
lifestyle intervention
 
context   a past history of gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   confer a very high risk of postpartum development of diabetes   particularly type 2 diabetes  
objective   the diabetes prevention program   dpp   seek to identify individual with impaired glucose
tolerance   igt   and intervene in an effort to prevent or delay their progression to diabetes   this analysis
examine the difference between woman enrol in dpp with and without a report history of gdm  
design   the dpp be a randomize   control clinical trial  
set   the study be a multicenter   national institutes of health sponsor trial carry out at
27 center include academic and indian health service site  
patient   a total of 2190 woman be randomize into the dpp and provide information for past
history of gdm   this analysis address the difference between those 350 woman provide a past
history of gdm and those 1416 woman with a previous live birth but no history of gdm  
intervention   subject be randomize to either standard lifestyle and placebo or metformin
therapy or to an intensive lifestyle intervention  
main outcome   the primary outcome be the time to development of diabetes ascertain by
semiannual fasting plasma glucose and annual oral glucose tolerance testing   assessment of
insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity be also perform  
result   whereas enter the study with similar glucose level   woman with a history of gdm randomize to placebo have a crude incidence rate of diabetes 71   high than that of woman without
such a history   among woman report a history of gdm   both intensive lifestyle and metformin
therapy reduce the incidence of diabete by approximately 50   compare with the placebo group  
whereas this reduction be 49 and 14    respectively in parous woman without gdm   these datum suggest
that metformin may be more effective in woman with a gdm history as compare with those without  
conclusion   progression to diabetes be more common in woman with a history of gdm compare
with those without gdm history despite equivalent degree of igt at baseline   both intensive
lifestyle and metformin be highly effective in delay or prevent diabete in woman with igt

subject and method
subject
the dpp design   eligibility   and baseline characteristic have be
report elsewhere   3   4    the study prespecifie a recruitment target and
plan hypothesis regard woman with a history of gdm   briefly  
3234 participant with igt be identify   qualified as having igt by
a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test and randomize to three different treatment group   placebo   metformin   and il   in 27 clinical center
throughout the united states   by entry criterion   all participant in dpp
be require to be old than 25 yr of age   eligibility require a fasting
plasma glucose value of 95 125 mg dl and a 2 h value   after a 75 g
glucose load   between 140 and 199 mg dl    the minimum fasting glucose
be not a requirement in the american indian center    at the time of
randomization   all woman complete a simple questionnaire relate to
their number of pregnancy and live birth and whether they be complicate by gestational diabetes   no further information on the index
pregnancy be possible due to the time past from the pregnancy until
recruitment   of 2190 woman in dpp   350 report a history of gdm
and 1840 do not   of the 1840 woman without history of gdm   321 have
never be pregnant   of the 1519 with pregnancy   1416 have at least one
live birth   this report restrict analysis to the 1416 woman without a
history of gdm report at least one live birth and all 350 woman with
a history of gdm because all report at least one live birth   of the 350
woman with a history of gdm   122 be assign to placebo   111 to
metformin   and 117 to il   whereas among the 1416 woman without a
history of gdm   487 be assign to placebo   464 to metformin   and
465 to il  
 
statistical analysis
baseline characteristic be describe use percentage for categorical variable and mean    sd for quantitative variable   for variable
with highly skewed distribution a logarithmic transformation be do
first   and the geometric mean be report instead   comparison
among group be do use the   2 test of independence for categorical
variable and the t test for quantitative variable  
cox proportional hazard model   6   be use to assess the effect of
the treatment group on the development of diabetes   analysis stratify
on report history of gdm be perform   and a test of heterogeneity

discussion
the historical observation of rapid and progressive development of type 2 diabetes after pregnancy complicate by gdm   2  
10   12   encourage dpp investigator to recruit such woman
into the study   our inclusion criterion require igt with an
elevate fast glucose and exclude those with diabetes  
thus exclude woman with early postpartum conversion to
diabetes   kjos et al    13   describe persistence of diabetes
postpartum occur in as many as 10   of woman with a
history of gdm and conversion to diabete in those normalizing glycemia postpartum occur quickly over the next
5 10 yr with a paucity of datum beyond that time   14    the
mean age of woman with a history of gdm enter dpp be
43 yr with a mean interval of 12 yr from the index gdm
pregnancy   suggest that we may have exclude many
woman with the high risk of diabetes conversion   despite
this and the fact that those report a history of gdm be
young   the dpp subgroup with a history of gdm have a
crude incidence rate of diabetes that be 71   high than that

cohort   we do not detect a significant benefit from metformin
therapy for this subgroup   with only a 14   risk reduction compare with placebo   although our study be not adequately powered for this subgroup comparison   in contrast   among woman

table 2 summarize the observed hazard rate for the development of diabetes in woman with and without a history of

those without a history of gdm   take into account these treatment effect   we estimate that only five to six woman with igt
and a history of gdm would need to be treat over 3 yr with
either metformin or il to prevent one case of diabetes   in
woman without a history of gdm   the estimate number
need to treat to prevent a single case of diabetes over 3 yr be
24 and nine for metformin and il   respectively

of parous woman without a history of gdm   even many year
after the pregnancy complicate by gdm   it appear that
woman continue to be at risk for development of diabetes  
therefore   continue follow up and test for diabetes

history of gdm  
although test of interaction between the effect of intervention and the history of gdm be not significant and the study

among those with a history of gdm   on average   these woman
be less able to sustain the prescribed level of physical activity
 
and demonstrate a low peak weight loss as well as a more

we estimate that metformin therapy   on the other hand

incidence of diabetes in those with a history of gdm compare with those without   this may in part be explain by the
young age   mean of 43 yr   of the gdm group because
woman between 25 and 44 yr of age within dpp as a whole have
a similar risk reduction with either metformin or il   but
metformin be no more effective than placebo in woman over

in summary   in dpp   woman with a report history of

with parous woman with a similar degree of glucose intolerance and no gdm history   intervention with metformin and
il be comparable in reduce the development of diabetes
with only an estimate five to six individual require treatment to prevent one case of diabetes over 3 yr   in woman
without a history of gdm as well as in the dpp cohort overall  
il be find to be far more effective than metformin therapy   in those with history of gdm   the absence of a difference
between il and metformin may be due to the minimal weight
loss achieve with il among gdm woman   we conclude that
woman with a history of gdm who currently have igt remain at an increase risk of develop diabete year after the
index pregnancy and appear to benefit from either lifestyle or
pharmacologic intervention

abstract   gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm    which be define as a state of hyperglycemia that
be first recognize during pregnancy   be currently the most common medical complication in pregnancy   gdm affect approximately 15   of pregnancy worldwide   account for approximately
18 million birth annually   mother with gdm be at risk of develop gestational hypertension   preeclampsia and termination of pregnancy via caesarean section   in addition   gdm increase the risk
of complication   include cardiovascular disease   obesity and impaired carbohydrate metabolism  
lead to the development of type 2 diabetes   t2 dm   in both the mother and infant   the increase in
the incidence of gdm also lead to a significant economic burden and deserve great attention and
awareness   a deep understanding of the risk factor and pathogenesis become a necessity   with

1   introduction
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be a state of hyperglycemia   fast plasma
glucose    5 1 mmol l   1 h    10 mmol l   2 h    8 5 mmol l during a 75 g oral glucose
tolerance test accord to iadpsg who criteria   that be first diagnose during pregnancy   1    gdm be one of the most common medical complication of pregnancy   and
its inadequate treatment can lead to serious adverse health effect for the mother and
child   1 2    accord to the late estimate of the international diabetes federation   idf   
gdm affect approximately 14 0    95   confidence interval   13 97 14 04    of pregnancy worldwide   represent approximately 20 million birth annually   3    mother with
gdm be at risk of develop gestational hypertension   pre eclampsia and termination of
pregnancy via caesarean section   4    in addition   gdm increase the risk of complication  
include cardiovascular disease   obesity   and impaired carbohydrate metabolism   lead
to the development of type 2 diabetes   t2 dm   in both mother and infant   5 7    the increase
in the incidence of gdm also lead to a significant economic burden and deserve great
attention and awareness   8   
despite numerous study   the pathogenesis of gdm remain unclear   and the result
obtain so far indicate a complex mechanism of interaction of many genetic   metabolic
and environmental factor   9    the basic method of treat gdm include an appropriate
diet and increase physical activity   and when these be inadequate   pharmacotherapy  
usually insulin therapy   be use   in develop country   such as brazil   oral hypoglycemic
agent be also use   mainly metformin and glibenclamide   glyburide    10    the prevention

and appropriate treatment of gdm be need to reduce the morbidity   complication
and economic effect of gdm that affect society   household and individual   though
it be well establish that the diagnosis of even mild gdm and treatment with lifestyle
recommendation and insulin improve pregnancy outcome   it be controversial as to which
type and regimen of insulin be optimal   and whether oral agent can be use safely and
effectively to control glucose level  
2   aim of the study

4 1   epidemiology
the grow problem of overweight and obesity around the world significantly contribute to the steady increase in the incidence of diabetes   include gdm in the population
of woman of reproductive age   11    accord to the 2019 report by the international diabetes federation   idf    more than approximately 20 4 million woman   14 0   of pregnancy  
present with disorder of carbohydrate metabolism   of which approximately 80   be

4 2   gdm risk factor
the incidence of hyperglycemia in pregnancy increase with age   accord to
moss et al    gdm be diagnose in 6 7   of pregnancy in general   but in 8 5   of woman
over 30 year of age   13    lao et al   show the high risk of develop gdm at the
age of 35 39 compare with young pregnant woman   or 95   ci   10 85   7 72 15 25  
vs   2 59   1 84 3 67     14    these observation be confirm by idf datum show the
high percentage of pregnancy with gdm reach 37   at the age of 45 49   which
be also condition by a low number of pregnancy with an accompany general
high percentage of diabetes in this population   3    the delivery of a macrosomic child
be another important factor that may increase the risk of both gdm and dm2 by up to

20    15    even after take into account the age of the woman   pluriparity remain in a
linear relationship to the incidence of gdm   16    gdm in a previous pregnancy increase
the risk of reoccurrence by more than six time   17    in woman with a bmi of at least
30 kg m2    the gdm frequency be 12 3    and in woman with first line relative that have
a history of gdm   it be 11 6    the combination of these two factor increase the risk of
gdm up to 61   of case   4 18 19    more than twice the percentage of pregnancy with
gdm be observe in woman that be previously treat for polycystic ovary syndrome
  pcos    20    recent study indicate that the prevalence of gdm be relate to the season
and that gdm prevalence increase during the summer compare with winter   21 23   
moreover   a 50   increase in the incidence of gdm in pregnancy result from in vitro
fertilization be describe   24   
4 3   diagnose gdm
the decade long polemic about the diagnosis of gdm have cover two issue  
whether to include all pregnant woman or only those with risk factor   and whether
to use one   or two stage diagnostic procedure   a gdm diagnosis be only possible if a
previous diagnosis of diabetes   I e    type 1 or type 2 diabetes   have be exclude early in
the pregnancy   screening of only risk group may result in gdm not be diagnose in as
many as 35 47   of pregnant woman   which be certain to affect obstetric result   25    the
result of the hyperglycemia adverse pregnancy outcome   hapo   study of 23 316 woman
give a clear outcome that elevate glycemia   but below the threshold for overt diabete
mellitus   show a linear relationship with the occurrence of maternal and neonatal complication express as large for gestational age   lga   endpoint   the frequency of caesarean
section   neonatal hypoglycemia and the concentration of the umbilical c peptide   26    the
current criterion for the diagnosis of gdm introduce by the international association of
diabete and pregnancy study group   iadpsg    which be base on the hyperglycemia
and adverse pregnancy outcome   hapo   result   find a threefold increase in gdm diagnosis   which suggest an early underestimation   the hapo group seek to identify new
screen value that would well identify pregnancy at risk for perinatal complication  
the hapo study demonstrate a positive linear relationship between screen glucose
value and adverse perinatal outcome   moreover   the study author find that perinatal
risk begin to increase in woman with glucose value that be previously consider
  normal    27 28    therefore   nowadays   the basis of gdm diagnostic be the administration
of 75 g of glucose between 24 and 28 week of pregnancy in all pregnant woman without
previously diagnose diabetes   the treatment of even mild form of glucose intolerance
in gdm offer an add benefit   as demonstrate by the australian carbohydrate intolerance study in pregnant woman   achois   and maternal fetal medicine unit network
  mfmu    it be show that the frequency of obstetric complication be reduce depend on hyperglycemia and pregnancy weight gain   in the achois study   the composite
endpoint   neonatal death   perinatal injury   hyperbilirubinemia   neonatal hypoglycemia
and hyperinsulinemia   be significantly reduce with antihyperglycemic intervention  
and there be also a low weight gain   by 1 7 kg on average   and a low incidence of
lga   in the mfmu study   no change be note in the composite endpoint   but the
incidence of lga and shoulder dystocia decrease significantly   2 29 30    the result of
these study show that most scientific society implement the recommendation of the
iadpsg from 2010 and who from 2013 into their daily practice   the introduction of the
iadpsg criterion for the screening of gdm increase the prevalence by threefold   albeit
with no substantial improvement in gdm related event for woman without risk factor
except for reduced risk for lga   neonatal hypoglycemia and preterm birth   31    this lead
to further research on a group of patient with gdm   in a large randomize trial   among
23 792 pregnant woman    hillier et al   show that one step screen   as compare with
two step screen   double the incidence of the diagnosis of gdm   but do not affect
the risk of lga   adverse perinatal outcome   primary caesarean section   or gestational
hypertension or pre eclampsia   32    the gem trial assess two diagnostic threshold

for gdm namely   the currently use   high diagnostic criterion and the iadpsg   low
diagnostic criterion for their effect on fetal growth   perinatal morbidity   maternal physical
and psychological morbidity   and health service utilization   the recently publish result
of the gem trial show that low glycemic criterion   fast plasma glucose level of at
least 92 mg dl   a 1 h level of at least 180 mg dl or a 2 h level of at least 153 mg dl   for
the diagnosis of gdm do not result in a low risk of a large for gestational age infant
than the use of high glycemic criterion   fast plasma glucose level of at least 99 mg dl
or a 2 h level of at least 162 mg dl    33    this late study be another important point in
the discussion of the good diagnosis method for gdm   table 2 present the criterion for the
diagnosis of gdm accord to different scientific society

which be insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction   as well as genetic   environmental
and dietary factor

4 4 1   insulin resistance
in the pathogenesis of gdm   as in type 2 diabetes   a key role be play by insulin
resistance and decrease insulin secretion relative to the patient s need   we observe gdm
in both obese and lean woman   37    insulin resistance induce by pregnancy overlap with
the pre pregnancy insulin resistance that be already present in obese woman   while in lean
woman   an impaired first phase of insulin secretion be also dominant   38    insulin resistance
in pregnancy be predispose by the diabetogenic effect of placental hormone   human
placental lactogen   hpl    human placental growth hormone   hpgh    growth hormone
  gh    adrenocorticotropic hormone   acth    prolactine   prl    estrogen and gestagen   
increase secretion of pro inflammatory cytokine   tumor necrosis factor alpha   tnf α   
il 6   resistin and c reactive protein   crp     adiponectin deficiency   hyperleptinemia and
central leptin resistance   impair glucose transport in skeletal muscle   impair insulin
receptor signal   and decrease expression and abnormal translocation of glut 4 to
the cell membrane of adipocyte   39 41    an increase secretion of insulin antagonistic
hormone   placental hormone   cortisol   during pregnancy result in an increase insulin
resistance   which   at the end of the third trimester   reach a value similar to full blow type
2 diabetes   9 42    subclinical inflammation in pregnant woman as a result of the synthesis
of pro inflammatory cytokine in the placenta and adipose tissue also lead to insulin
resistance   43 44    so far   the effect on the development of insulin resistance due to tnf α  
il 6 and c reactive protein have be well study   kirwan et al   state that an increase in
insulin resistance   which be characteristic of pregnancy   most strongly correlate with the
increase in tnf α concentration   consider that tnf α as a marker of insulin resistance
during pregnancy   45    furthermore   hyperleptinemia in the first week of pregnancy be
a predictor of the development of gestational diabete   accord to qui   the determination of the leptin concentration    31 0 ng ml in the 13th week of pregnancy cause a
4 7 fold increase in the risk of gdm compare with the risk at the level of leptinemia
of   14 3 ng ml   for every 10 ng ml increase in leptin concentration   the risk of gdm
increase by 21    46    at the same time   gdm be characterize by elevated concentration
of leptin   which lead to hyperleptinemia   47    however   pre pregnancy bmi be a strong
predictor of leptinemia than gdm perse   48    in woman with gestational diabetes   the
concentration of adiponectin be low than in pregnant woman without disturbance of
carbohydrate metabolism   regardless of their pre pregnancy bmi   49    it be show that a
low adiponectin concentration in the first and second trimester of pregnancy be a predictor
of diabetes development in pregnancy   50    in the barbour study   a 1 5 2 fold increase in
the level of the p85α pi 3 kinase regulatory subunit be find in both the muscle and
adipose tissue of obese pregnant and pregnant gdm woman compare to obese nonpregnant woman   in woman with gdm   a 62   increase in the phosphorylation activity
of irs 1 serine residue be find in striate muscle cell compare with the control
group of pregnant woman without gdm   which point to insulin resistance post receptor
mechanism   43   
4 4 2   β cell dysfunction
the analysis of insulin secretion disorder in gdm give inconclusive result   the
mechanism of β cell hypertrophy and proliferation   result in a 300   increase in insulin
secretion in the first two trimester of physiological pregnancy   be insufficient to explain
gdm   9 39    in the pathogenesis of gdm   we also observe the influence of autoimmune
and genetic factor   such as the presence of anti insulin and or anti insulin antibodie  
which be at risk of develop dm1 and latent autoimmune diabetes in adult   lada    51   
in cross sectional study   the prevalence of mutation in the gene variant gck   hnf1a  
hnf4a   hnf1b and in in maturity onset diabete of the young   mody   be 0 5    52   
great hope in the search for the genetic cause of gdm be associate with research on the
single nucleotide polymorphism   snp   relate to the cyclin dependent kinase 5   cdk5  
regulatory subunit associate protein1 like1 gene   ckdal1    their presence be associate

with an impaired first phase of insulin secretion in dm2 and gdm and lead to a decrease
in the mass of beta cell and impairment of their function   lead to gdm   53 54   
4 4 3   other factor
a study conduct in spain show that carrier of the gene rs7903146 t allele who follow the mediterranean diet in early pregnancy have a low risk of develop gdm   55   
a grow body of research provide evidence of the importance of dna methylation
in the regulation of gene expression associate with metabolic disturbance in pregnant
woman and in the metabolic programming of the fetus in the setting of gdm induce
hyperglycemia   56 58    in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue sample   the insulin
receptor mrna protein expression be significantly reduce in woman with gdm
  p    0 05    56    mother with gdm display a significantly increase global placental
dna methylation   3 22    0 63 vs   3 00    0 46     sd    p    0 013    57    additional light
be shed on the pathogenesis of gdm by study on disorder of the placental proteome  
where the placental proteome be alter in pregnant woman affect by gdm with
large for gestational age   lga    with at least 37 protein be differentially express to
a high degree   p    0 05   as compare with those with gdm but without lga   59    in
addition   khosrowbeygi et al   show that woman with gdm have high value of tnf α
  225 08    27 35 vs   115 68    12 64 pg ml   p    0 001   and low value of adiponectin
  4 50    0 38 vs   6 37    0 59 µg ml   p    0 003   and the adiponectin tnf α ratio
  4 31    0 05 vs   4 80    0 07   p    0 001   than normal pregnant woman   the ratio of
adiponectin tnf α   which decrease significantly in gdm compare with normal pregnancy   might be an informative biomarker for the assessment of pregnant woman at high
risk of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and for the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring
aim regard gdm   60   
4 5   covid 19 pandemic and gdm
the second severe acute respiratory distress syndrome   sea   coronavirus   sar cov 2  
cause an acute respiratory disease call coronavirus disease 2019   covid 19    there be
limit datum on the impact of sar cov 2 infection on the onset and course of gdm   a
live systematic review and meta analysis of 435 study report the incidence of covid19 in pregnant woman of approximately 10    7 14     61    the covid 19 pandemic have
cause organizational difficulty relate to the correct diagnosis of gdm   in anglo saxon
country   in order to minimize the risk of infection with sar cov 2   replacement of the
three point ogtt be propose and the assessment of fast blood glucose and hba1c
be introduce   postpartum screen postponement and the use of telemedicine be
also offer   62    however   simplify the diagnosis of gdm in order to avoid the risk of
covid 19 infection be unfortunately associate with the risk of not diagnose gdm by
as much as 20 30    which may affect obstetric outcome   63 65    this be confirm by
another study that show that in the   covid era    diagnostic toward gdm can not be
abandon and the procedure for its detection can not be simplify   66    the covid 19
pandemic increase the incidence of gdm in 2020 compare with 2019   13 5   vs   9   
p    0 01    especially in woman in the first trimester of pregnancy   experience lockdown
during the first trimester of gestation increase the risk of gdm in these woman by a factor
of 2 29   p    0 002   compare with woman whose pregnancy occur before and after
lockdown   67    this be undoubtedly influence by the sedentary lifestyle of woman during
the pandemic and reduce physical activity   most often cause by the fear of leave their
home due to covid 19   68    the   lockdown effect   cause a marked deterioration in
glycemic control   an increase in the percentage of hba1c   and weight bmi gain in patient
with dm2 and gdm   69 70   
4 6   treatment of gestational diabete
regard woman with gdm   due to the lack of randomize clinical trial   it be
extremely difficult to propose an unambiguous and uniform model of management in order

to achieve obstetric result similar to the population of healthy woman   the treatment
of gdm be base on consensus and expert opinion   analysis of cochrane database
review show the lack of unambiguous datum on the correlation between the intensity of
glycemic control and obstetric outcome   71    base on a meta analysis from 2014 2019  
mitanchez et al   indicate that the great impact on reduce the number of obstetric
complication be achieve by combine dietary treatment with exercise   72   
4 6 1   nutritional treatment
nutritional recommendation help woman to achieve normoglycemia   optimal weight
gain and proper development of the fetus   and the introduction of a pharmacological
treatment do not release the mother from the obligation to follow the diet   73    in gdm  
it be necessary to develop an individual nutritional plan base on glycemic self control  
optimal weight gain base on pre pregnancy bmi   and a calculation of energy requirement
and macronutrient proportion   as well as take into account the mother s nutritional
preference   together with work   rest and exercise   73    indicate well result when use individualized recommendation for a specific woman with gdm in
contrast to general recommendation   74    it be recommend to eat three main meal and
2 3 snack a day   often with a snack around 9 30 pm to protect against nocturnal hypoglycemia and morning ketosis   6    in a prospective observational study use the 24 h
online diet and glycemic tool    myfood24 gdm     well glycemic control be demonstrate with more frequent meal   75    in woman with gdm   carbohydrate be the most

to its transplacental passage and limited long term follow up data   further clinical trial
be necessary to use other oral hypoglycemic agent to treat gdm   it be very important
for patient with gdm to receive behavioral therapy and to closely cooperate with the

1   introduction
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm    which be deﬁne as
diabete diagnose in the second and third trimester of
pregnancy   1    have emerge as a global public health concern
  2    it have be associate with short term and long term
adverse health outcome for both mother and their newborn   3    woman with gdm be know to have decrease
quality of life and increase risk of caesarean section   gestational hypertension   preeclampsia   and type 2 diabetes   4 7   
in baby   gdm have be find to be associate with macrosomia or large than normal gestational aged infant   neonatal hypoglycemia   and type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life
  6   8   9    as such   it be important to understand the burden
 
of gdm in various part of the world to provide countryspeciﬁc information to help inform on policy and planning  
the global prevalence of gdm vary widely   from 1  
to 28    depend on population characteristic   e g   
maternal age   socioeconomic status   race ethnicity   or body
composition    screening method   and diagnostic criterion
  10    in addition   as with the common form of type 2 diabetes   11    gdm can also be inﬂuence by genetic factor  
which may diﬀerently aﬀect disease prevalence among
population   12    to date   at least 8 association have
develop their own diagnostic criterion for gdm   namely

asia be the large and most populated continent   60   of
the world s population    with an increase prevalence of
gdm   19    while maternal overweight obesity be an establish risk factor for gdm   20    particularly in hic   recent
review have find that the prevalence of gdm may be even
high among lean population than those with a large body
size   2    this be consistent with the developmental origin of
adult disease hypothesis   dohad   as undernutrition in the
ﬁrst 1000 day be associate with later diabetes   21 24    the

give the rapid socioeconomic and nutrition transition and
the increase prevalence of gdm in asia   19   27    it be of
public health importance to provide an overview of this condition in eastern and southeastern asia   however   accessible
and systematically organize estimate of gdm prevalence
in this subregion be lack   moreover   the lack of uniformity in screen method   deﬁnition   and diagnostic criterion
for gdm make it diﬃcult to compare the prevalence of
gdm between and within country   the aim of this study
be to undertake a systematic review and meta analysis of

3 6   prevalence of gdm by country   there be variation in
the overall prevalence of gdm   with vietnam and singapore show the high rate   20 06   and 18 93    resp    
while mainland china and malaysia have a comparable
prevalence of gdm   11 91   and 11 83     the remain
country   japan   korea   taiwan   and thailand   have a
gdm prevalence of less than 8 0    it should be note that
mainland china account for nearly 50   of the total
study   n    21    table 1   
 
4   discussion
the present review include 48 study with more than three
and a half million participant from 7 country in eastern
and southeastern asia   show a wide variation in the overall prevalence of gdm   the pool prevalence of gdm be
approximately 10    with a high estimate in lmic than
in hic   the discrepancy in the overall estimate also exist
accord to diagnostic criterion and country   the most
widely use criterion be ada 2012   iadpsg   or who
2013   result in a pool prevalence of gdm of 14   while
only a limited number of study use adip 1998   icd 10  
jsog   ada 2004   or ada 2010   the high prevalence of
gdm be find in vietnam and singapore   where approximately one in ﬁve woman be diagnose with gdm  
follow by mainland china and malaysia where about one
in 9 woman have gdm   the remain country have no
more than one in 14 woman with gdm   to the good of our
knowledge   this be the ﬁrst study that systematically synthesise datum on the prevalence of gdm in important subregion of asia   eastern and southeastern   and provide
accessible evidence to formulate locally feasible strategy
for eﬀective and eﬃcient prevention of gdm in asia  
overall   approximately one in 10 pregnant woman in
eastern and southeastern asia have gdm   this ﬁnding be
high than african country   where the average prevalence
of gdm be about 6 0    17    similarly   our datum be great than
result report in western country include europe   we  
and australia   with the prevalence of gdm be 5 4   
9 2    and 5 7    respectively   84 86    we have no clear
reason for such a discrepancy   but we speculate that it
may be due to socioeconomic   racial ethnic   or lifestyle disparity   for instance   asian woman be reportedly have
a high risk of gdm compare with their caucasian  
african american   and hispanic counterpart   87    this
observation suggest that the development of gdm may
be shape by early life exposure to poor nutrition   that be  
under   or overnutrition   and or epigenetic accord to
the dohad theory   88    another factor may be the different screening regime and testing method that will be
discuss below  
the lack of consensus regard the use of diagnostic
criterion for gdm be largely attributable to the heterogeneity of gdm prevalence   of diverse diagnostic criterion such
as nddg   89    cc   90    ada   91    and who   92    the
iadpsg criterion base on the hyperglycemia and adverse
pregnancy outcome study   hapo   have recently become
more accepted   93    indeed   the use of iadpsg criterion
may produce an estimate prevalence of gdm two to
 
journal of diabetes research
threefold even up to 7 fold high than other criterion   13  
94    in a brazilian study   for instance   the prevalence of
gdm be only 2 3   and 7 1   accord to ada 2010 and
who 1999   respectively   but it increase to 18 0   follow
the iadpsg criterion   94    an alternative explanation for the
variation in gdm prevalence may be ascribe to diﬀerent
screen method   that be   the one step or two step
approach   similar to our review   a recent meta analysis of
40 study in europe report that the one step screen
method result in a high prevalence of gdm compare
with the two step procedure   86    although a one step
screen type be simple   less laborious   and of low lose   it
typically overestimate the prevalence of gdm   95    however a two step screening method be more accurate and could
accordingly reduce personal and societal cost despite its
inconvenience for patient and increase workload for
healthcare professional   96    give the lack of international
consensus in screening and diagnostic method for gdm   it
be imperative to develop a standardised approach to allow
for comparison of gdm burden worldwide  
the high prevalence of gdm in less wealthy country
review here be consistent with study from other part
of asia and africa   17   18    likewise   around 90   of case
of hyperglycemia during pregnancy occur in low   and
middle income nation as report by the international diabetes federation in 2015   27    this discrepancy may be associate with limited access to maternal health care and or low
socioeconomic status in low   and middle income economy
  27   97   98    it be evident from this review that the prevalence
of gdm in vietnam   a low middle income country   at
least triple the correspond datum in hic such as japan  
taiwan   and south korea   it can also be speculate that the
diﬀerence in lifestyle factor   e g    diet and physical activity   
acculturation   and urbanisation may explain the variation in
gdm prevalence between the two aforementione countryincome group   99    this ﬁnding imply that improvement
of socioeconomic condition may contribute to the prevention of gdm  
on the other hand   more epidemiological study on
gdm in the remain country of eastern and southeastern asian region include mongolia   indonesia  
philippines   myanmar   cambodia   and laos need to be conduct to add information to the current evidence   these
study should be perform in both urban and rural population in order to compare and evaluate the eﬀect of urbanisation on gdm in particular and public health in general  
the present review have the advantage of a large sample
size with study involve over three and a half million
woman   use diﬀerent method for screening and diagnosis
of gdm and consistency of method   quality   and focus  
there be several limitation that need to be consider when
interpret the result of this work   our review indicate
substantial heterogeneity of gdm prevalence across study  
make direct comparison diﬃcult   such variation may be
attributable to the potential inﬂuence of screen procedure   I e    selective or universal   for gdm and its diagnostic
criterion   population characteristic   or other socioenvironmental factor   nonetheless   those possible modiﬁer be
not take into account in this review due to the lack of datum

available from include study   in addition   the inclusion of
only english publication may have result in publication
bias   our review do not address gdm situation in other
country in the region include indonesia   philippine  
myanmar   cambodia   and laos due to the lack of datum   and
thus   the ﬁnding may not be generalisable to the whole eastern and southeastern asia  
 
5   conclusion
a large scale review of literature show that around one in 10
pregnant woman in eastern and southeastern asia have gdm
and the number of woman with gdm varied substantially
between and within country   the prevalence of gdm be
high accord to ada 2012   iadpsg   or who 2013 criterion   great follow a one step screening procedure and
higher in lmic   the ﬁnding suggest the need for develop an international uniformity regard screening and
diagnostic method for gdm

objective   the international association of diabetes and pregnancy study group
  iadpsg   have propose new criterion for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus
  gdm    the aim of this study be to compare the prevalence of gdm when iadpsg
criterion be use with the prevalence when the current australasian diabete in
pregnancy society   adip   criterion be use  
design   setting and participant   this be a prospective study over a 6 month period  
examine the result of all glucose tolerance test   gtts   conduct for the diagnosis
of gdm in wollongong   a city use the public and private sector  
main outcome measure   the prevalence of gdm use the exist   adip   and the
propose   iadpsg   criterion  
result   there be 1275 evaluable gtts   571 public and 704 private    use the current
adip diagnostic criterion   the prevalence of gdm be 8 6    public    10 5    private   and
9 6    overall    use the propose iadpsg criterion   the prevalence of gdm be 9 1  
  public    16 2    private   and 13 0    overall   
conclusion   the propose iadpsg criterion would increase the prevalence of gdm
from 9 6   to 13 0    p    0 001    in our study in the wollongong area   which have a
population with a predominantly white background   this increase come mainly
from old woman attend a private pathology provider   datum from both the public
and private sector need to be include in any discussion on the change in prevalence
of gdm

method
this study be carry out in the new south
wales city of wollongong   which have a
population of about 280 000 people   the
vast majority of obstetric service for this
population be conduct within the area  
 
there be between 3000 and 3300 birth
each year in the public and private sector  
about one third of birth occur in a private
hospital and two third in public hospital  
a previous study have demonstrate more
than 90   compliance with universal testing
for gdm 10 thus   in a 6 month period   it
could be anticipate that between 1450 and
1500 woman would be test for gdm  
the adip criterion for gdm be base on
the result of either the fasting or the 2 hour
plasma glucose level after a 75 g glucose
tolerance test   gtt    a diagnosis of gdm be
establish if the fast plasma glucose
level be    5 5 mmol l or the 2 hour level be
   8 0 mmol l   unless a gtt be indicate
early   all pregnant woman in wollongong
be offer a gtt at the beginning of their
third trimester   no preliminary challenge
test be use   use the adip criterion   only
fast and 2 hour plasma glucose sample
have be use  
the iadpsg criterion have propose a
diagnosis of gdm if any of the following
plasma glucose level be establish   fast
plasma glucose level     5 1 mmol l   plasma
glucose level 1 hour after glucose load  
   10 0 mmol l   or 2 hour after glucose

mja    volume 194 number 7    4 april 2011
 
load     8 5 mmol l   to prepare for the possible new criterion and to compare the current prevalence of gdm use the adip
and iadpsg criterion   all pregnant woman
have a gtt have fast   1   and 2 hour
blood sample take   this be do for a
6 month period from the beginning of january 2010 until the end of june 2010   and be
continue  
the overwhelming majority of gtts carry out during pregnancy in the wollongong area be conduct by the public
hospital or a dominant private pathology
provider   southern iml pathology    which
have 18 collection centre across the area and
one central laboratory   for the network of
public hospital   testing be do at wollongong hospital for woman attend the
antenatal clinic   other woman be test
at the private pathology provider   about half
the woman attend the private pathology
provider be patient of obstetrician in
private practice   and half be in a sharedcare arrangement with a general practitioner
and would eventually be manage at the
antenatal clinic of a public hospital  
all gtts be conduct accord to a
standard procedure   the woman be ask
 
 
discussion
one of the strength of the hapo study and
the subsequent iadpsg deliberation be
that the result appear to be applicable to
different ethnic group and in different
country   this raise the possibility of
worldwide   evidence base consensus criterion for the diagnosis of gdm   the iadpsg
criterion would have diagnose 17 8   of the
woman in the hapo study with abnormal
glucose tolerance   it be probable that the
propose new criterion will diagnose a great
proportion of woman than the current
adips criterion   and it be this potential
increase in the number of woman be
diagnose that will need to be consider  
 
the prevalence of gdm in the wollongong area have be consistent for over 10
year   having be report as 7 2   in
199310 and 6 6   in 200311 use datum from
the public and private sector   these datum
be collect independently from the government statistic   which have be show
to be unreliable   and underestimate the
prevalence of gdm 12
in our study   we ascertain gdm at the
point of testing   and use datum from the
public and private sector   the current prevalence of gdm in wollongong use adip
criterion be 9 6   for the total population  
range from 8 6   in woman attend the
public hospital to 10 5   in woman attend a private pathology provider   a previous
report11 have also demonstrate difference
in the prevalence of gdm between the
public and private sector   use the propose new iadpsg criterion   the prevalence
of diagnose gdm will increase to 13 0   
with difference between the public   9 1   
and the private sector   16 2    
the overall prevalence of 13 0   be similar
to that at other australian site   application
of the iadpsg criterion to the two australian
city participate in the hapo study indicate a gdm prevalence in brisbane of
12 1   and in newcastle of 13 6   13
record ethnicity datum at the time of the
gtt be not practical   give that there be
18 different collection centre operate by
the private pathology provider   the prevalence of gdm vary greatly   depend on
the rate of type 2 diabetes in the population
be test and on maternal age   centre
with a high proportion of mother from
ethnic background particularly at risk
  middle eastern   pacific islander   asian and
indian woman   will have a high prevalence and an early onset of type 2 diabetes  
and hence a high prevalence of gdm  
in australia in 2007   the most recent datum
available   14 83 5   of woman give birth
be bear in australia or be from country with a predominantly caucasian background   in the wollongong area in 2009  
89 4   of pregnant woman be bear in
australia or come from country with a
predominantly caucasian background   this
rate be slightly high than   but not dissimilar to   the australian rate 14 so we feel
confident that the incidence of gdm
report here will be reasonably representative and can be use as a source for national
estimate  
previously   the adip criterion diagnose
the majority of woman with gdm on the
basis of the 2 hour post glucose load test

result   the propose adoption of the
iadpsg diagnostic criterion will mean a paradigm shift   with far great emphasis be
place on the fast plasma glucose level  
the figure of 57   of woman be diagnose on the result of the fast test in the
wollongong area be similar to the 51  
report from the iadpsg analysis of the
hapo study result  
this study have strength and weakness  
the strength be that it be prospective   of
reasonable size and have an ethnic distribution not dissimilar to the national datum   it
also include   by gather datum from the
public and private sector   almost all of the
test do in a city over a 6 month period  
give the difference in the prevalence of
gdm between the two sector   we feel that
any future meaningful discussion about the
prevalence of gdm must not be confine to
public hospital but must include the wide
private sector  
the major weakness be that we be
unable to record the woman s country of
birth at the time of collection   however  
give their predominantly caucasian background   these datum would be unlikely to
significantly influence the overall result  
adoption of the iadpsg criterion for the
diagnosis of gdm will increase the prevalence of diagnose gdm in the wollongong
area from 9 6   to 13 0    the potential
disadvantage of the new criterion relate to
resource allocation   the absence of cost  
benefit analysis and the potential for cause harm due to increase obstetric and
neonatal intervention   concern about
increase workload   particularly in area
with a high proportion of woman from an
ethnic background at high risk of gdm  
have recently be outline 15 however   the
advantage be the iadpsg criterion have a
strong evidence base for outcome and may
well become the international standard

  55 5     the prevalence of gdm across the age group of
woman in urban area be range from 10 6   to 35 8   
high prevalence be observe in the age group of 3034 year   in the case of semi urban area   the prevalence
of gdm be range from 7 8   to 48 4   and the agespecific prevalence of gdm in 30 34 yrs be 35 7    as

discussion
in this community base study   we prefer to
perform universal screening as selective screening
base on risk factor score poorly in predict
gdm 6 7 universal screening for gdm detect more
case and improve maternal and offspring prognosis
compare to selective screening   8 the universal
screening appear to be the most reliable and desire
method for the detection of gdm 6 particularly in those
population with high risk for gdm 9 10 for universal
screen   the test should be simple and cost effective  
the two step procedure of screen with 50 g glucose
challenge test   gct   and then diagnose gdm base
on oral glucose tolerance test   ogtt   be not feasible
in a country like india   because the pregnant woman
may have to visit the antenatal clinic twice and at least

resent and moreover   no show   rate be high 4 11 12 who
recommendation serve both as one step screening and
diagnostic procedure   easy to perform besides be
economical13 and thus minimizes non responder bias in
the prevalence estimate   who criteria of 2 hr pg    140
mg dl identify a large number of case may have a
great potential for prevention 14 15
the current recommendation be to perform screen
test between 24 and 28 week of gestation   though there
be report that claim about 40     66   of woman with
gdm can be detect early during pregnancy 16 17 the
ideal period to screen for gdm be around 16 week
of gestation and even early in high risk group
with a history of fetal wastage   18 gdm diagnosis
may not be miss by screen around 24   28 week
of gestation   but a substantial number of pregnant
woman who develop gdm in the early week of
pregnancy be likely to have delay diagnosis and
may not receive appropriate medical care   far   early
screen for glucose intolerance and care could avoid
some diabetes relate complication in woman with
gestational diabete and their newborn 19 base on
these observation   we initiate the screening procedure
for gdm in antenatal woman irrespective of gestational
week   among the gdm woman detect in this study  
35 4   be    24 week of gestation and this include
12 4   of gdm woman   16 week of gestation   woman
detect to have gdm in the early week of pregnancy
may be true gdm or undiagnosed pre exist diabete
detect during screen 20 a1c be likely to distinguish
these two condition 21 but this study be community
base   it be not economically feasible to perform the
test   another observation of this study be that woman
who have normal glucose tolerance in the first visit  
develop gdm in subsequent visit   hence repeat
screening become essential   out of 1679 gdm woman  
1204 72    be detect in first visit and the remain
28   in subsequent visit  
in this study   we screen 4151   3960 and 3945
pregnant woman   2005    2007   in the urban   semi urban
and rural area respectively   the prevalence of gdm
be 17 8   in the urban   13 8   in semi urban and 9 9  
in rural area   the prevalence of gdm vary from one
region to another in the same country   22 24    we also

live in the urban area than in rural area 25 the low
prevalence in the rural area may be due to the less
mechanize   agriculture base lifestyle adopt by
these people whereas the factor contribute to high
prevalence in the urban area could be increase maternal
age   obesity and sedentary lifestyle  
establish risk factor for gdm be advanced
maternal age   obesity and family history of diabetes
  26    the increase in the prevalence of gdm in our study
could be attribute to increase bmi   as high maternal
weight be associate with a substantially high risk of
gdm 27 in our study   the datum from all the three area
show that 16   of woman have a bmi    25 kg m2 which
confirm that increase bmi be a risk factor for gdm  
similar to the finding of dempsey et al   we also observe
increase prevalence of gdm in less active woman 28
jang et al find that the gdm woman be old  
have high pre pregnancy weight   high bmi   high
parity and high frequency of know diabete in the
family 29 in our study population all these risk factor
be observe   of all the independent risk factor for
gdm   bmi emerge as a modifiable risk factor  
in conclusion   this study document the varied
prevalence of gdm in the urban   semi urban and
rural area of the community   gdm be detect in
all trimester of pregnancy   we also observe bmi as a
risk factor for gdm which be modifiable   gdm woman
have high risk of develop diabete in the future  
they be the ideal group to be target for lifestyle
modification or pharmacologic intervention in order
to delay or postpone the onset of overt diabete   hence
an important public health priority in the prevention of
diabetes be to address maternal health both during ante
and post partum period   we suggest more study from
the rest of the country

clinical recommendation
universal screening for gestational diabetes be recommend by some expert   but the u s  
preventive service task force find the evidence insufficient to recommend universal screening  
in patient diagnose with gestational diabetes   glucose monitoring should be undertake use
fast and two hour postprandial glucose level to guide treatment  
treatment with diet control or pharmacotherapy should be direct base on blood glucose level  
antenatal testing   include ultrasonography   nonstress testing   and amniotic fluid index   should
be perform to monitor fetal status  
woman with gestational diabete be at an increase risk of type 2 diabetes and should be
screen postpartum at routine interval

fetal assessment
there be no consensus on the optimal
approach to fetal surveillance in pregnancy complicate by gdm   antenatal testing in woman who have gdm that be well
control without medication be not beneficial 40 because the risk of stillbirth be not
increase in this population 41 antenatal
testing be commonly perform in woman
who require medication for gdm   although
datum support this practice be limit to
old observational study   the american
college of obstetrician and gynecologist
  acog   recommend that clinician perform antenatal testing in accordance with
local practice pattern 2 such testing could
include twice weekly nonstress test or
weekly modify biophysical profile begin at 32 to 34 week of gestation  
the role of ultrasonography in pregnancy complicate by gdm varie among clinician and institution   some physician
obtain serial ultrasonography   separate by
at least four week   to monitor fetal growth
in patient with gdm   several small trial
have find that institute tight glycemic
control for woman with accelerated fetal
growth may result in a low incidence of
large for gestational age infant 42 however  
large study be need before routine use
of ultrasonography to guide management
of gdm can be recommend   especially
because undergo third trimester ultrasonography may be an independent risk factor
for cesarean delivery 43
other physician perform ultrasonography near the end of pregnancy to assess the
risk of fetal macrosomia   however   a sonographically estimate fetal weight of great
than 4 000 g   8 lb   13 oz   be only modestly
predictive of an actual fetal weight great

comment
our study demonstrate substantial variation of
prevalence and risk factor of gdm across racial  
ethnic group   advanced maternal age   overweight  
obesity   family history of type 2 diabetes   and foreignborne status be show to be significant contributor
to gdm in our study population   which have diverse
racial ethnic and cultural background   together   the
study risk factor account for almost two third of
the risk for gdm   range from 57 2   among nhws
to 71 1   among filipinos   the observe variation in
paf can be attributable to racial ethnic difference in
relative risk and prevalence rate of these risk factor  
from a public health perspective   overweight  
obesity be consider the most important risk factor
for gdm because it be the most modifiable among
the four study risk factor   our finding provide
quantitative evidence to support this statement  
overweight obesity be associate with the large
adjust paf for gdm across all racial ethnic group
study   except for chinese   when cdc standard bmi
cut off point be use   overweight obesity be a
more important risk factor for nhws and hispanic
than for asian americans because of its high relative risk and high prevalence among nhws and
hispanic   the use of who ada bmi cut off point

for asians increase the prevalence of overweight  
obesity and strengthen the association between
overweight obesity and gdm risk for asians   when
use who ada cut off point for asians   the
overweight obesity paf suggest that in this cohort  
up to 39 0    of gdm among asian indians   15 9  
among chinese and 38 2   among filipinos could be
attribute to pre pregnancy overweight obesity   this
finding support the use of who ada bmi cut off
point for asian americans because the standard bmi
cut off point may misclassify overweight obesity
status among asian americans and underestimate the
impact of be overweight obesity on gdm   consistent with the recent ada position statement   our
study suggest that low bmi cut off    23 kg m2  
should be apply to asian americans when screen for gdm   in addition to type 2 diabetes  
advanced maternal age and family history of type 2
diabete be also important risk factor for gdm  
advanced maternal age be particularly important for
nhws and hispanic because of its strong association with gdm risk in these population compare
with asian americans   we speculate that these difference represent the way the pathophysiology of
gdm may differ by race ethnicity   replication in
future study be need   similarly   although family
history of type 2 diabetes be associate with increase
gdm risk among all study racial ethnic group   it
be more powerful for asian indians and chinese   both
family history and maternal age be generally consider non modifiable   however   public health and
medical care approach can be employ to reduce
their impact on gdm   for example   information about
gdm risk associate with advanced maternal age can
help woman make an informed decision about pregnancy timing   in addition   special care and patient
education such as culturally sensitive family base
intervention can be provide to woman with a family
history of type 2 diabetes to help prevent gdm and
type 2 diabetes because they be at elevated risk for
both condition 27
also consistent with our hypothesis   we find that
foreign borne nhws   hispanics   chinese   and filipinos have a significantly high risk of gdm compare
with their us borne counterpart   this corroborate
finding from another study that evaluate gdm by
race ethnicity and country of birth 14 finding from
our study far demonstrate that disparity in
gdm risk exist in foreign borne woman even after
control for other gdm risk factor   although it

remain unclear why the foreign borne population
have a significantly high risk for gdm   health care
organisation and policymaker should consider provide culturally tailor prevention and intervention
to immigrant population to help they maintain a
healthy lifestyle and to buffer the negative effect of
potential risk exposure   in addition   base on our
finding   who ada bmi cut off point for asians
should be apply to the asian immigrant consider their particularly high risk for gdm   in addition  
future study be need to more fully explore the
impact of acculturation on gdm among foreign borne
mother   as length of time in the we be likely a well
marker of acculturation than simply place of birth  
which be the only variable available to we for analysis
on the current birth record  
the main strength of this study include use information from a large health care organisation with a
uniquely diverse population enrich with asian
americans   although the majority of patient in the
study cohort have health insurance and thus medically
underserve population be under represent  
this geographic and socioeconomic limitation also provide well internal validity for racial ethnic group
comparison by minimise potential unmeasured
socioeconomic confounder   in addition   information
from both ehr and state birth certificate be use
complementarily to well capture mother   characteristic and their gdm outcome   furthermore   by use
the paf we take both relative risk and population
prevalence of these risk factor into account when assess their contribution to gdm in this population  
the finding from this study should be interpret
with caution   first   the prevalence of gdm may be
underestimate because our study include all
pregnancy   not just pregnancy that be screen
for gdm at the study organisation   however   we use
gdm status from the state birth certificate to augment
gdm test result and diagnosis in the ehr   in fact  
very few gdm case be report additionally on
the state birth certificate   our estimate of gdm
prevalence be comparable with finding from prior
study 12 13 second   paf assume a causal association
between a risk factor and outcome   thus   we have
focus on well document risk factor for gdm  
the study design and exposure ascertainment
method ensure that these risk factor precede the
outcome   confounder of the risk factor gdm association be control for in the multivariable regression model   and adjust rr be use for
 
computing paf   third   because paf can be influence
by the prevalence of exposure to the risk factor in the
population   result in our study population may not
apply to another population with a different gdm
risk factor profile   however   we find comparable
paf estimate for overweight obesity with previous
finding from the state of florida   suggest some
robustness of our estimate 28 fourth   we use prepregnancy bmi information from the state birth
record   although this be the well available information on pre pregnancy bmi   we should be aware that
some of this information be self report and thus
subject to self report bias   finally   we identify
mother with gdm use information from ehr and
the state birth certificate   two third   66    of gdm
case be identify through ehr only   3   through
state birth certificate record only   and 31   through
both datum source   regard the disagreement of
gdm case between ehr and state birth certificate
record in our study   we conduct further analysis
and find no significant difference in maternal characteristic   race ethnicity   maternal age   bmi   family
history of type 2 diabetes   foreign borne status  
between gdm case identify by ehr and state birth
certificate record   previous national study have
indicate that state birth certificate may underestimate
gdm prevalence when compare with other datum
source such as the pregnancy risk assessment monitor system questionnaire 1 our study suggest that
the use of ehr may provide important complementary information to state birth certificate  
 
conclusion
asian americans be one of the fast growing
racial ethnic minority group and have be show
to have the high rate of gdm among all racial  
ethnic group   in order to reduce the overall burden
of gdm   future study should focus on tailor lifestyle modification and weight control to reduce the
prevalence of risk factor in these population   for
example   the who ada bmi cut off point for
asians should be apply to asian mother for screen and intervention purpose

gdm be define as glucose intolerance of
vary degree with onset or first recognition during
pregnancy1   prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus
vary widely   depend on the population study and
the diagnostic test employ   prevalence may range
from 2 4 to 21 per cent of all pregnancies2 5   in india
it be difficult to predict any uniform prevalence level
because of wide difference in living condition   socioeconomic level and dietary habit   zargar et al4 find
the prevalence of gdm to be 3 8 per cent in kashmiri
woman   in a random survey perform in various city

in tamil nadu   gdm be detect in 17 8 per cent
woman in urban   13 8 per cent woman in semi urban
and 9 9 per cent woman in rural areas5  
the datum regard prevalence of gdm and the
number of woman affect be important to allow for
rational planning and allocation of resource and the
preventive strategy that may be undertake in future  
because widely different prevalence rate have be
observe in study in different region of india   multiple

gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be a well characterized disease affect a significant population of pregnant
woman worldwide   it have be widely link to undue weight gain associate with factor such as diet   obesity  
family history   and ethnicity   poorly control gdm result in maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality   improve
outcome therefore rely on early diagnosis and tight glycaemic control   while straightforward protocol exist for
screening and management of diabetes mellitus in the general population   management of gdm remain controversial
with conflict guideline and treatment protocol   this review highlight the diagnostic and management option for

introduction
gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm    by definition   be
any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy   1   2    this definition apply
regardless of whether treatment involve insulin or diet
modification alone   it may also apply to condition that
persist after pregnancy   gdm affect roughly 7    of
pregnancy with an incidence of more than 200 000
case per year   2    the prevalence   however   vary from
1 14     depend on the population and the diagnostic
criterion that have be use   2   
gdm be the most common cause of diabetes during
pregnancy   account for up to 90    of pregnancy
complicate by diabetes   2    woman with gdm have a
40 60    chance of develop diabetes mellitus over the
5 10 year after pregnancy   3   
although gdm have be recognize as a disease for
some time   it remain a controversial entity with conflict
guideline and treatment protocol

the first screening test for gdm   propose in 1973  
consist of the 1 h 50 gm oral glucose tolerance test   4   
while some guideline recommend universal screening  
other exempt those patient who be categorize as lowrisk   evidence suggest that universal screening improve
pregnancy outcome compare to selective screening   5   
however   other researcher argue that screen woman
base on their clinical characteristic allow for more efficient selective screening for gdm   6   
low risk patient include those woman with the follow characteristic    25 year of age   normal body
weight   no first degree relative with diabetes   no history
of abnormal glucose metabolism   no history of poor

islander    7   8    although some expert recommend
against screen these low risk patient routinely   2    selective screening could miss approximately 4    of patient
with gdm   9   
pregnant woman with factor confer a high risk of
gdm   mark obesity   previous history of gdm   glycosuria   or family history of diabetes   should be screen
for gdm as soon as possible   preferably during their

28 week of gestation   woman who be categorize as
average risk   neither high nor low risk   should also be
screen between 24 and 28 week of gestation   2   
when universal screening be implement   patient with
no recognize risk factor for gdm also undergo a 1 h
glucose challenge test at 24 to 28 week of pregnancy  
the classification criterion be summarize in table 1   6   
fast plasma glucose and postprandial plasma glucose
have be show to have low sensitivity as screen test
for gdm   10   11    and therefore they be not recommend for screen  
in general   there be two approach to the evaluation
of woman for gdm   the one step approach and the twostep approach   in the one step approach   a diagnostic oral
glucose tolerance test   ogtt   be perform without prior
plasma or serum glucose screen   this approach may be
cost effective in high risk patient   in the two step approach   initial screening involve the glucose challenge
test   which measure the plasma or serum glucose concentration 1 h after a 50 gm oral glucose load   the diagnostic
oral glucose challenge test be perform only in the subset
of woman find to have plasma or serum glucose concentration value exceed the threshold for the glucose
challenge test  
when the threshold for glucose challenge test be
  140 mg dl   7 8 mmol l    the sensitivity be 80     when
it be 130 mg dl   7 2 mmol l    the sensitivity become

criterion and the national diabetes data group   nddg  
criterion   the carpenter coustan criterion derive from
the work of o sullivan and mahan   4    which carpenter
and coustan modify in 1982   12    in this method  
diagnosis of gdm be base on exceed two or more
of the follow threshold value  
 
  fast serum glucose concentration of 95 mg dl
 
  5 3 mmol l  
 
  1 h serum glucose concentration of 180 mg dl
 
  10 0 mmol l  
 
  2 h serum glucose concentration of 155 mg dl
 
  8 6 mmol l  
 
  3 h serum glucose concentration of 140 mg dl
 
  7 8 mmol l  
the nddg criterion   meanwhile   be slightly less inclusive
than the carpenter coustan criteria   13    furthermore   the
nddg criterion be find to be less sensitive in diagnose
gdm and in predict incidence of perinatal morbidity
  14    the nddg criterion be also base on exceed two
or more of the threshold value   which be as follow  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fast serum glucose concentration of 105 mg dl
1 h serum glucose concentration of 190 mg dl
2 h serum glucose concentration of 165 mg dl
3 h serum glucose concentration of 145 mg dl
 
alternatively   the american diabetes   ada   criterion
for gdm diagnosis rely on a 75 gm glucose load and
consider fast serum glucose concentration   1 h glucose concentration   and 2 h glucose concentration   15   
the glucose threshold value be   respectively   95 mg dl
  5 3 mmol l    180 mg dl   10 0 mmol l    and 155 mg dl
  8 6 mmol l    again   two or more abnormal value be
require for diagnosis   although these major criterion all require two or more abnormal value for diagnosis   study
have show that a single abnormal value be significantly
associate with increase risk of perinatal morbidity   16   
the world health organization   who   recommend
use a 75 gm glucose tolerance test for screening and
diagnosis   the threshold value be a fast glucose
concentration of more than 126 mg dl   7 0 mmol l  
and or a 2 h glucose concentration of more than
140 mg dl   7 8 mmol l    17    when the who criteria
be use   approximately twice as many patient will be
diagnose with gdm compare to other criterion   however   there be no proven additional clinical benefit with
the use of who criteria   18    the criterion for diagnosis
of gdm be summarize in table 2  
treatment
 
evidence show that screen for and treat gdm
lead to the reduction of perinatal morbidity and the

be glycaemic control   1    glycaemic control have be
show to reduce adverse outcome in pregnant woman
with gdm   20   21   
target glucose value
 
expert recommend that woman with gdm should
maintain the follow capillary blood glucose value   preprandial glucose   95 mg dl   5 3 mmol l    1 h postprandial
glucose   140 mg dl   7 8 mmol l    and 2 h postprandial
glucose   120 mg dl   6 7 mmol l    1    the american college of obstetric and gynaecology   acog   have similar
guideline   the only exception be that both 130 mg dl
and 140 mg dl 1 h postprandial glucose value be consider acceptable   22    other recommendation suggest maintain fast glucose level of   90 99 mg dl
  5 0 5 5 mmol l    1 h postprandial glucose level of
  140 mg dl   7 8 mmol l    and 2 h postprandial glucose
level of   120 127 mg dl   6 7 7 1 mmol l    23   
even if it be not possible to achieve the recommend
level of glycaemic control   any improvement can be
beneficial give that perinatal complication be link
to increase serum glucose value   21   24    despite the
benefit of glycaemic control   however   study have
show that very low target glucose value    87 mg dl  
be associate with increase rate of intrauterine fetal
growth retardation   20   
medical nutrition therapy   mnt  
 
the first line of management for woman with gestational
diabetes mellitus be dietary modification   often call
medical nutrition therapy   25    evidence indicate that
nutrition therapy be effective in reduce pregnancy and
perinatal complication and also in attain glycaemic
control   25   
accord to ada recommendation   carbohydrate
intake should be approximately 40    of total calorie intake
and should be select from food with low glycaemic
index value   26    in pregnant woman of normal body
weight   bmi between 18 5 24 9    the recommendation be
to consume 30 32 kcal kg body weight   especially during
the second half of pregnancy   27    however   those who be
overweight   bmi of 25 to 29 9   should ingest approximately
 
25 kcal kg body weight   28    other guideline recommend
caloric intake base on bmi as follow   30 kcal kg for
a bmi of 22 25   24 kcal kg for a bmi of 26 29   and
12 15 kcal kg for a bmi of   30  
75 80    of woman with gdm become euglycaemic
by follow these caloric distribution guideline   assess fast ketonuria provide a method of confirm a
woman s caloric restriction   because caloric restriction of
at least 50    have be associate with ketogenesis   29   
on the other hand   moderate caloric restriction of about
33    have be associate with control glucose level
without elevation of free fatty acid and ketonaemia
  28   29    caloric restriction should be approach cautiously   because study show that elevate maternal
ketone level be associate with impair psychomotor
development   30   
compare to diet alone   exercise with dietary modification have be find to lead to improve glycaemic
control in one study   31    the propose mechanism for
such an improvement in glycaemic control be heighten
sensitivity of peripheral tissue to insulin   a supervised
home base cycling program be helpful in maintain
normal postprandial glucose level in pregnant woman
with diet control gdm   32    that say   another trial
use a partially home base exercise program find no
reduction in blood glucose level   33    this cohort do
demonstrate improve cardiovascular fitness   however  
base on the available evidence on the benefit of exercise in manage gdm   ada recommend moderate
exercise program for woman without medical or obstetrical complication   15    there be no specific guideline  
however   on how to employ exercise regime to achieve
glycaemic control   for the general population   expert
tend to recommend exercise 3 or more time a week
for about 30 min  
pharmacotherapy
 
pharmacological intervention in the management of
gdm be usually employ when woman fail to meet
establish goal with conventional therapy of diet and
exercise   it be also indicate when elevate fast glucose
level occur while on conventional therapy   because dietary modification have limit effect on these level   although most woman achieve adequate glycaemic control
 
 
mpondo et al   journal of diabetes    metabolic disorder   2015   14 42
 
with conventional therapy   30 40    do require the
addition of pharmacologic therapy at some point during
their pregnancy   34    the pharmacological option in
this case include insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agent
  metformin and glyburide    35   36   
insulin
 
insulin therapy be the most commonly use pharmacotherapy once mnt fail to achieve desire outcome  
insulin regimen often include intermediate act insulin
such as isophane and short act agent such as regular
recombinant insulin   humulin r    pharmacotherapy can
also involve the insulin analogue aspart and lisipro   insulin
therapy decrease the frequency of fetal macrosomia and
the risk of perinatal morbidity   37    positive history of diabetes mellitus in a first degree relative and multiple abnormal value in the ogtt be strongly find to predict the
need for insulin management in woman with gdm   38   
study have show that insulin analog   lispro and
aspart   be more effective than regular human insulin in
achieve target glucose value and minimize the
risk for macrosomia   39   40    there be limited datum on
the use of long act insulin in pregnancy   for woman
with gdm who require insulin   isophane be therefore the
intermediate act insulin of choice   23    insulin analogue lispro and aspart have be widely study and
find to be clinically effective with minimal transfer
across the placenta   these agent have similar safety profile
to human insulin   39    because the insulin analogue have
short duration of action and more rapid onset of action
than regular insulin   they be associate with improved
postprandial glycaemic control and less postprandial
hypoglycaemia   41    glucose value that necessitate initiation of insulin be summarize in table 3  
 
page 4 of 7
 
insulin secretion by the pancreas   it can be use as an alternative for woman who be unable or unwilling to take
insulin or   in some case   as a first line pharmacological
therapy   study have show that glyburide   unlike other
sulphonylurea   do not cross the placenta in vivo or
in vitro   43   44   
study examine the use of glyburide and insulin
for the management of gdm have find comparative
maternal and neonatal outcome   45   46    regard
glyburide therapy   certain factor be associate with
high rate of success   include initiation after 30 week
gestation or fast blood glucose level   110 mg dl and
1 h postprandial glucose level   140 mg dl   47    despite
several study support the efficacy and safety of glyburide for woman with gdm   acog and ada guideline do
not recommend its use until large randomize control
trial be complete on the subject   15   22    however   a
survey conduct by acog find that up to 13    of
american fellow prescribe glyburide as a first line
pharmacological agent in woman with gdm   48   
metformin
 
metformin be another oral hypoglycaemic agent consider
a potential substitute for insulin in gdm management   in a
randomize control trial involve woman with gdm  
the use of metformin   whether alone or with supplemental
insulin   be not associate with increase perinatal complication compare to insulin alone   49    meanwhile   a 2013
meta analysis find that metformin be comparable to insulin regard glycaemic control and neonatal outcome
  50    in another recent study   metformin use be associate
with similar desirable outcome when compare to mnt
and insulin use   its use be not associate with a high risk
of maternal or neonatal complication   51   
glucose monitoring
 
oral hypoglycaemic
 
oral hypoglycaemic agent use in the management of
gdm should be both effective and safe for the woman
and develop fetus   with the exception of glyburide and
metformin   oral hypoglycaemic drug be generally not recommend due to concern about potential teratogenicity
or prolong neonatal hypogylcaemia from drug transport
across the placenta   42   
glyburide
 
glyburide   one of the two oral hypoglycaemic drug use
for the management of gdm   act primarily to enhance
 
in patient require insulin   the ideal frequency for glucose monitoring have not be establish   in common
practice   the patient generally check glucose level four
time a day   23    once upon wake in the morning   before
meal   before bed and one or two hour postprandially to
ensure adequate glycaemic control   postprandial glucose
level be preferable to fast glucose level   because they
be more strongly associate with macrosomia   52    insulin dose adjustment base on postprandial glucose level
rather than preprandial level be show to be associate
with improvement in glycaemic control and reduction of
both maternal and fetal adverse outcome   53

between physician   patient and primary care provider be
essential   as patient experience increase rate of gdm in

the author declare that they have no compete interest  
 
intrapartum management
 
during labor   woman on pharmacological therapy require hourly evaluation of their glucose value   while
those with diet control gdm do not require active
glucose management   patient on insulin usually have
normal level of glucose at the time of labor and also do
not need active management   23

gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   have classically be define as any glucose
intolerance first identify during pregnancy 1 recently   the american diabete
association   ada   define it as   diabete diagnose in the second or third trimester
of pregnancy that be not clearly overt diabetes   2 however   as per iadpsg   international association of diabetes and pregnancy study group   criterion   woman can be
diagnose to have gdm even in the first trimester   if fast plasma glucose   fpg  
be   5 1 mmol l   92 mg dl    but   7 mmol l   126 mg dl   3
gdm be associate with an increase risk of complication for both mother and
baby   during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum period   screening and identify
these high risk woman be important to improve short and long term maternal and fetal
outcome 4 however   there be lack of international uniformity in the approach to the
screening and diagnosis of gdm 5 this be surprising   give that the strategy for make a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus be uniform across the world 2 the main reason for
the diagnostic dilemma of gdm be the large number of procedure and glucose cutoff
propose for the diagnosis of glucose intolerance in pregnancy 6 the first diagnostic
criterion propose by o sullivan in 1964 and its subsequent modification   carpenter
and coustan   be base on the maternal risk of develop type 2 diabetes   rather
than on pregnancy outcome   recently   the recommendation from iadpsg attempt
to redefine gdm in term of adverse pregnancy outcome   base on hyperglycemia
and adverse pregnancy outcome   hapo   study result 6 but   we be still far from
attain a holistic criterion which be base on both short and long term outcome

the main purpose of this review be to provide an update
on screen for gdm and overt diabete during pregnancy  
and discuss the controversy in this field   we take on debatable issue such as adoption of the new iadpsg criterion
instead of the carpenter and coustan criterion   one step versus
two step screen   universal screening versus high risk
screen before 24 week of gestation for overt diabete  
and   finally   the role of hba1c as a screening test of gdm  
this discussion be follow by a review of recommendation
by professional body   certain clinical situation   in which
a pragmatic approach be need   be highlight to provide
a comprehensive overview of the subject  
 
evolution of screen criterion
for gdm
the first systematic evaluation of the oral glucose tolerance
test   ogtt   for the diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy be
do by o sullivan et al in the 1950 and 1960   since then  
the 100 g ogtt have undergo extensive modification  
to its present form   that be   carpenter and coustan criterion
  1982   6 7 recently   iadpsg criterion have also come into
the picture 3
 
100 g ogtt
the original diagnostic criterion   base on blood glucose
testing before and hourly for 3 hour after 100 g glucose
intake for gdm   be propose by o sullivan and mahan
in 1964 8 base on a series of 752 woman who undergo
ogtts during pregnancy   mean and standard deviation
  sds   be derive for each of four whole blood glucose
value   define as mean plus 1   2   or 3 sd    o sullivan and
mahan decide that two abnormal value would be need
for gdm diagnosis   the decision be base upon the desire
to avoid misclassification due to laboratory error or the occasional individual with a single high glucose peak due to rapid
absorption   approximately 2   of pregnant woman fulfil
the criterion of mean plus 2 sd   and these criterion become the
basis for the diagnosis of gdm in the usa   the diagnostic
criterion be apply to a separate group of 1 013 woman
who undergo 100 g ogtts during their pregnancy   the
risk of subsequent diabetes be 27   after a follow up period
of 8 year   when value at 2 sd be use as the diagnostic
threshold during pregnancy 6 8
in 1979   the national diabetes datum group criterion
  nddg   convert the whole blood glucose threshold to the
plasma value   approximately 14   higher as compare with
the original o sullivan and mahan criterion    in response to
the general change in laboratory standard from whole blood

to plasma or serum 6 9 subsequently   new laboratory technology for glucose measurement use glucose oxidase and
hexokinase method   lead to the formulation of the carpenter
and coustan criterion 6 10 the original o sullivan and mahan
criterion be establish use somogyi nelson technology  
the somogyi nelson method be not specific for glucose  
and also measure approximately 0 27 mmol l   5 mg dl  
of nonglucose reduce substance   glucose oxidase and
hexokinase method   on the other hand   measure only
glucose   in 1982   carpenter and coustan use the glucose
oxidase method to derive a set of criterion by first subtract
5 mg dl from o sullivan and mahan s original value and
then add 14   to each   to account for the conversion from
whole blood to plasma glucose value    and   finally   round
to the near 5 mg dl   0 27 mmol l    this formulate the
carpenter and coustan criterion 6 7 10
 
75 g ogtt
the initial recommendation for use 75 g ogtt in pregnancy be from the world health organization   who   
the who use the same criterion for diagnose diabete
both during and outside of pregnancy 11 this approach be
criticize   as it ignore the physiological change in carbohydrate metabolism that occur during pregnancy   in 1999  
the who11 lower the threshold for fpg from 7 8 mmol l
  140 mg dl   to 7 0 mmol l   126 mg dl   and recommend
that pregnant woman meet the criterion for diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance   igt   be classify as
have gdm  
all these criterion have a common problem   namely   they
be validate for predict the future risk of diabete only
in the mother 6 10 a need be feel to derive new criterion link level of glycemia to pregnancy and fetal outcome   the
current 75 g iadpsg criterion have be devise keep this
fact in mind and evaluate evidence that associate abnormal
glucose tolerance in pregnancy with adverse perinatal outcome 3 unblinded study since 1995 have show adverse
perinatal outcome to be linearly link with glycemic level
in gestation 5 the landmark study in this respect be the
hapo study 12 the hapo study be a large   multicenter  
multinational   epidemiologic study in which 23 316 woman
   30 time large than the o sullivan cohort   underwent
blind 2 hour   three sample   75 g ogtts at 24 32 week
of gestation   all woman with a fast plasma glucose
  fpg    5 8 mmol l   105 mg dl   and 2 hour value up
to 11 1 mmol l   200 mg dl   be include   the hapo
clearly establish a linear relationship between each of the
glucose value   fast   1 hour   and 2 hour   on ogtt and a
 
international journal of woman s health 2015 7

broad range of predefine pregnancy outcome   the primary
outcome in the hapo study be the frequency of large forgestational age   lga    90th centile   baby   primary cesarean section   clinical neonatal hypoglycemia   and neonatal
hyperinsulinemia   all of these primary outcome as well as
secondary outcome like fetal adiposity   preeclampsia   and
birth trauma shoulder dystocia be relate to each of the
maternal ogtt glucose result in a continuous fashion   the
independent association of hyperglycemia with pregnancy
outcome persist after extensive adjustment for potential
confounder include maternal body mass index   bmi    age  
height   mean arterial pressure   and parity 5 12
in 2008   the iadpsg recommend the establishment
of new diagnostic criterion for gdm base on datum from the
hapo study   the diagnostic threshold would have to be
somewhat arbitrary   because of the linear association between
glycemic value and pregnancy outcome   the diagnostic
threshold that be decide by the iadpsg consensus panel
be base on glucose level that give 75   increase risk of
birth weight   90th centile   cord c peptide   90th centile   and
percentage body fat   90th centile as compare with mean
glucose level of woman of hapo cohort   on this basis   the
iadpsg recommend a fast glucose level of 5 1 mmol l
  92 mg dl    a 1 hour level of 10 0 mmol l   180 mg dl    or
a 2 hour value of 8 5 mmol l   153 mg dl   as diagnostic for
gdm 3 the iadpsg criterion have be endorse by who  
ada   and the endocrine society of usa 2 13 14
 
controversy   should iadpsg
criterion be adopt universally  
the prevalence of gdm increase by two   to threefold if
the iadpsg criterion be adopt for screen   there be
an ongoing debate whether such an increase in prevalence
allow identification of previously ignore risk   or result
in overmedicalization of healthy pregnancy 5 15 20 there be
a need to closely look at argument on both side  
 
argument against adopt iadpsg
criterion universally
 
weak association of complication with glycemic
level
the lack of association between perinatal mortality and
high blood glucose level   as observe in the hapo study  
have be use as a strong counterpoint by the detractor of
the iadpsg criterion 12 16 the association between secondary
endpoint   shoulder dystocia   premature delivery   hyperbilirubinemia   and preeclampsia   and glycemic level be
significant   but clinical relevance of this finding be limit as
 
international journal of woman s health 2015 7
 
screen for gestational diabete
 
these complication be relatively infrequent   the association between maternal blood glucose and certain endpoint
like neonatal hypoglycemia   birth weight   cesarean section
rate   and preeclampsia either disappear or become weak
when maternal characteristic such as bmi be take into
account 12 16 19
 
increase rate of intervention and adverse effect
the diagnosis of gdm   irrespective of the degree of glucose
control achieve   per se lead to increase intervention  
early delivery   an increase cesarean section rate   even if
birth weight be normalize by treatment    and a high number
of neonatal admission to special care nursery 16 17 20 this
phenomenon have be observe in the australian carbohydrate intolerance study in pregnant woman   achois   21
the basis for this finding be not entirely clear   but it may be
relate to the overcautious approach adopt by caregiver in
pregnancy with diabetes   these complication may be more
frequent in routine clinical setting   outside of control
research setting 16 17
low diagnostic value will apparently low target
glucose value imply that more woman will be treat
with glucose lower therapy   this may increase the risk
of maternal hypoglycemia and poor fetal growth   which in
turn will contribute to metabolic disorder in adulthood   all
these intervention create stress and anxiety among woman
diagnose as have gdm 16 20
 
evidence of no treatment benefit for mild gdm
from rct
two landmark randomize trial perform by crowther et al
  achois   and landon et al   maternal fetal medicine
unit   mfmu   influence the recommendation for gdm
diagnosis   by iadpsg 21 22 analyst point out that these two
trial be different from the hapo study and should not
have be consider along with it 16 17 the broad difference
between they and the hapo study be discuss here  
1   trial design   these be intervention trial to investigate
the effect of gdm treatment   diet and or insulin   on
perinatal outcome   whereas the hapo study be an
observational study  
2   inclusion exclusion criterion   unlike hapo   where woman
irrespective of previous gdm be include   both study
exclude woman with such a history  
3   diagnostic criterion   both study use a two step diagnostic procedure but with different diagnostic criterion  
the criterion for the achois study be positive 50 g

a serious outcome   unlike in the hapo study   in which
perinatal mortality be not a part of the assessment   in the
achois study 21 the routine care group show a high
prevalence   4   vs 1    of composite primary outcome of
  any serious perinatal complication    however   some of
the death could not plausibly be attribute to the nontreatment of gdm   for example   one infant have a lethal
congenital anomaly   and another have severe intrauterine
growth retardation   in the mfmu trial 22 no difference
be find between the group in the composite primary
outcome score

association of complication with glycemic level
accord to the investigator of the hapo study   glycemia be more strongly associate with the primary study
outcome as compare with maternal bmi 25 26 the effect
of these two variable on primary outcome be additive  
without a statistically significant interaction 25 the consensus panel choose feature of diabetic fetopathy   namely  
the frequency of birth weight   90th centile   percent body
fat   90th centile   and cord c peptide   90th centile for
the determination of diagnostic glucose threshold   these
be key phenotypic feature of baby directly relate to
the pathophysiology of gdm and may also link with future
metabolic abnormality in adulthood   the select threshold also identify an increase risk of more severe   though
less frequent   adverse pregnancy outcome 27
 
meta analysis of treatment trial
a recent meta analysis of the treatment rct   include   and
dominate by   the achois and mfmu trial   conclude
that the only pregnancy outcome affect by lower the
threshold for detection and treatment of gdm be a reduction
in macrosomia   odd ratio   or   0 38   95   ci   0 30 0 49   
lga infant   or 0 48   95   ci   0 38 0 62    and the incidence of shoulder dystocia   or 0 40   95   ci   0 21 0 75   23
in summary   the intervention trial in gdm confirm that
treatment contribute to a 2   3   reduction in birth weight  
lead to a low incidence of   big baby   and shoulder
dystocia   moreover   the risk benefit ratio for treatment be
debatable   the author of the achois trial calculate an
nnt   number need to treat   of 34 to prevent   any serious
perinatal complication    but an nnh   number need to
harm   of 11 for induction of labor or admission to neonatal
nursery 21
 
argument in favor of adopt iadpsg
criterion universally
expert in favor of iadpsg criterion argue that the national
institute of health   nih   panel s report and other critique
have fail to address the issue of increase prevalence
of prediabete and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes   outside

increase in adverse effect and intervention
iadpsg recommendation represent a well reason consensus view as to the level of glycemia that be   sufficient
to merit identification and treatment    these criterion   if
thoughtfully implement   will appropriately identify and
allow treatment of the metabolic abnormality of gdm   this
will lead to well establish benefit   in term of immediate
pregnancy outcome   and likely benefit   in term of future
maternal and offspring health 5 15
 
evidence of treatment benefit for mild gdm
from rct
expert favor the iadpsg criterion argue that there be a
high degree of congruence in the result of these two trial
  achois and mfmu   21 22 as discuss in detail here  
1   glycemic threshold at entry   despite different diagnostic
criterion of the two trial   as compare with the hapo
study   the subject recruit in all study have glycemic
value comparable to those in the hapo study 5 12 15 21 22
in the achois study   the fpg value be use only
to exclude woman   initially use fpg 7 8 mmol l

mark fast hyperglycemia to be include in this trial  
however   as this degree of fast hyperglycemia be very
uncommon in pregnancy when the 2 hour plasma glucose
be   11 1 mmol l   200 mg dl    this criterion be rarely
invoke 15 21 landon et al22 apply a much more stringent criterion   exclude woman with fpg 5 3 mmol l
  95 mg dl   
the mean fpg of 4 8 mmol l   86 mg dl   be similar in
both achois and mfmu rct   the median 2 hour
glucose of the achois cohort be actually close to the
iadpsg recommend 2 hour diagnostic threshold  
mean that if this value alone be to be use for diagnosis   around 50   of these woman   who benefit from
intervention   would not have be diagnose as have
gdm 15
2   advantage of treatment of gdm   both study show
a reduction in complication with the identification and
active treatment of mild gdm   this be see in term
of mean birth weight   frequency of lga 21 22 reduction
in fat mass   and in the reduction of shoulder dystocia 22
hypertensive disorder of pregnancy   gestational hypertension and preeclampsia   be also substantially reduce
by active gdm treatment 21 22 maternal weight gain be
lessen by active therapy 21 22 induction of labor be
increase by active treatment in the crowther study 21 but
not in the landon study 22 the frequency of cesarean section be unchanged in the achois study 21 and reduce
in the mfmu study 22 a subsequent systematic review
conclude that the observe reduction in lga   shoulder
dystocia   and preeclampsia be consistent across these
and other available report 28 as for perinatal mortality  
the hapo study be not power to detect a difference in perinatal mortality   and for ethical reason   the
protocol be design to minimize the risk of perinatal
mortality  
 
consensus
the relationship between hyperglycemia and adverse
pregnancy outcome be well define through a large volume
of congruent observational epidemiologic datum   which be
also consider for iadpsg recommendation  
the major observational study have generally be perform with a 75 g ogtt   without prior gct   the result  
in particular the association with excess fetal growth and
its complication and the risk of pregnancy hypertension  
remain consistent despite vary method of analysis  
no study find a clear diagnostic threshold or   inflection
point   for any glucose measure above which risk increase

screen for gestational diabete
 
sharply   therefore   any decision regard threshold value
for gdm diagnosis will   by definition   be arbitrary   base
on an individual or consensus view of the level of risk that
be   sufficient   to merit the gdm label   the underlie principle of the iadpsg consensus process be 1   that woman
with equivalent level of glucose associate risk should be
classify in a similar manner   and 2   that glucose criterion
should be standardize internationally 27
 
universal testing for hyperglycemia
in pregnancy in first trimester
pregnant woman with overt diabete and suboptimal blood
glucose control in early pregnancy be at increase risk of
have a fetus with congenital anomaly and be also at
increase personal risk of worsen of diabetic retinopathy
and nephropathy   early diagnosis of previously undiscovered
overt diabete in a pregnant woman may allow for the rapid
institution of therapy to mitigate these risk   as the frequency
of obesity and t2 dm in young adult be increase worldwide   most guideline now recommend screen for overt
diabete at the first prenatal visit   especially in high risk
group 2 13 14 18 19 29
the cutoff for test   recommend to detect diabete in
early pregnancy be fpg   126 mg dl   7 0 mmol l    random
plasma glucose   200 mg dl   11 1 mmol l    or hba1c   6 5  
  47 mmol mol    same as recommend for nonpregnant
population 3 however   the who do not consider hba1c for
the diagnosis of overt diabete in pregnancy 14 it be generally
consider that there be not enough evidence to recommend
the screening and treatment of gdm before 24 week of
gestation 30 and some professional organization still recommend risk factor base screen in the first trimester 18 19
iadpsg recommend that an fpg 92 mg dl   5 1 mmol l  
in early pregnancy be classify as gdm 3 this recommendation remain highly debatable as the figure be base on datum
extrapolate from the cutoff value use on the 75 g ogtt
later in pregnancy   a recent evaluation of the fpg in the
first prenatal visit to diagnose gdm in people s republic of
china show that an fpg level between 110 and 125 mg dl
  6 1 6 9 mmol l   be a much well predictor of the development of gdm and that   for their population   an fpg level
of 92 mg dl   5 1 mmol l   at the first prenatal visit could not
be support as the criterion for the diagnosis of gdm 31
however   the recommendation of iadpsg for the diagnosis of overt diabetes be agree upon even by the strong
critic of the propose criterion of iadpsg for the diagnosis
of gdm 16 base on available evidence   universal screening

an advantage of the widely use two step test   nonfaste
50 g glucose challenge   follow   if positive   by a fasting
ogtt   be that woman have to   fail   two test to be diagnose
with gdm   so one can be more confident that indeed they
have significant glucose intolerance   the propose one step
test   while administratively more convenient   lose this discriminate power 16 this concern have be raise in view
of poor reproducibility of ogtt   as illustrate by study
that have look at the result of woman have two 100 g
ogtts at short interval   with two elevate glucose result
out of four require to diagnose gdm    nearly a quarter of
woman change diagnostic category on the second test    with
a similar number go from abnormal to normal as the other
way round 32 33 reliance on a single blood glucose result in
a one step screening test   especially use low threshold  
will have even poor precision   moreover   first step by gct
have the advantage that it can be perform throughout the
day without the need to be in fast condition 19

on the basis of two abnormal value in 100 g ogtt be
also arbitrary   how gct evolve and get incorporate
into a two step strategy be also a speculation   as it be not
evidence base 5
the two step screen precede by gct follow by
full ogtt inevitably delay the diagnosis of gdm and
therefore treatment 34 a systematic review compare the
50 g gct and the ogtt   either 75 or 100 g   to estimate
the sensitivity and specificity of the gct for gdm 35 for
consecutively recruit patient   the pool sensitivity be
0 74 for a specificity of 0 85   meaning that the process of
perform gct and then ogtt miss around 26   of
potential gdm diagnose 35 at certain place   the figure
may be even high   as gct screening miss many of those
with gdm with a modestly elevate fast glucose   recent
datum from the hapo study suggest that 63   73   of case
in north american center be diagnose on the basis of
an elevated fast glucose level alone 36 the other serious
concern about use a gct be the no show rate for the definitive ogtt for woman who be abnormal   in the toronto
tri hospital gestational diabetes project   10   of woman
do not proceed with the gtt 37 in a new zealand study  
the rate be 23   38 a recent north american report find
that only 36   attend the ogtt 39 the cost effectiveness
of two step screening have to be weigh against inadvertent
delay and miss diagnosis   and with their resultant potential
maternal and fetal complication 40
the result of gct be influence by the timing of meal  
and that of test   a recent study show that among woman
with a positive gct   those test in the afternoon have
well metabolic function and a low risk of gdm on subsequent ogtt 41 this suggest that the time of testing may
lead to misclassification of patient with markedly elevated
gct result if gdm be diagnose without confirmation by
ogtt  
a recent prospective observational study randomize
786 pregnant woman to screen for gdm either with a onestep method use a 75 g ogtt use iadpsg criterion

role of hba1c in screen for
gestational diabetes mellitus
although the hba1c reference interval for the general population be well establish   reference interval for healthy
pregnant woman be not clearly define 43 a study in india
show that by use different range of hba1c for the
iadpsg criterion and the old ada criterion   an ogtt could
be avoid in approximately 40    iadpsg   and 60    ada  
of woman   respectively 44 however   the hapo study show
that association with adverse outcome be significantly
strong with glucose measure than with hba1c 45
different study report different trend in hba1c during
pregnancy   increase   decrease   and no change in hba1c level
during pregnancy have be report by different research
group 43 davy and welborn46 show that mean hba1c
level tend to rise after the first trimester of pregnancy in both
normal and diabetic patient   this occur despite the fact that
fbg level tend to fall in normal pregnancy   and in the diabetic patient   control of blood glucose level improve with
the progress of pregnancy   they propose that some factor
other than the level of glucose in the blood must be operate  
since if hba1c reflect only the average blood glucose level  
it must fall with the progress of pregnancy   an explanation
 
international journal of woman s health 2015 7
 
for this phenomenon be not clear   pollak et al47 indicate that
hba1c do not alter with the progress of pregnancy   widness
et al48 find in a group of 13 nondiabetic woman a significant
fall in hba1c from the first to the third trimester   mcfarland
et al also report a decrease in hba1c from the first half of
pregnancy to the third trimester 49
altogether   the finding suggest that an hba1c measurement be not a useful alternative to an ogtt in pregnant
woman

obstetrician   the endocrine society guideline recommend
test all pregnant woman   use the same diagnostic cutoff that be recommend in the nonpregnant population 13
whereas the ada recommend test woman with risk

the acog and an independent expert panel assign by the
nih continue to promote the use of the two step screen
strategy with the nonfaste 50 g gct and if abnormal   follow by the 3 hour 100 g ogtt use the carpenter and
coustan criterion or the nddg criterion 18 19 recently   both
the who and the endocrine society have advocate the
use of the iadpsg criterion for the diagnosis of gdm 13 14
adip also advocate one step test 29 the 2015 ada
recommendation specify that further research be need to
establish a uniform approach to diagnose gdm   and now
 
leave the option open between the one step iadpsg recommendation and the two step screening strategy 2
 
hba1c in screen for gestational
diabetes mellitus
hba1c be not recommend for screening of gdm by any of
 
the guideline 2 13 14 18 19 29 this may be due to scarce datum on
this aspect   physiological change in red cell mass and turnover occur during pregnancy also make interpretation of
hba1c in relation to glycemic level difficult in pregnancy 43
however   hba1c be recommend by iadpsg to rule out
overt diabete in the first trimester 3
the recommendation on various aspect of screen
be summarize in table 3  
 
pragmatic approach
screen for gdm be an essential part of obstetric care   the
only controversy be how to screen for the condition   the first
diagnostic criterion propose by o sullivan in 1964 and its
subsequent modification   carpenter and coustan   be base
on the maternal risk of develop type 2 diabetes   rather
than on neonatal outcome   iadpsg   in contrast   attempt to
redefine gdm in term of neonatal and short term maternal
outcome   but we be still far from attain a holistic criterion
base on both short   and long term outcome   criterion base
on the maternal risk of develop type 2 diabetes would
appear to underdiagnose   whereas those base on only shortterm outcome may over diagnose gdm   a decision tree that
balance neonatal outcome concern with maternal outcome
and risk from treatment would seem to be the way forward  
eventually   this require more study and datum   of course  
even though the iadpsg criterion aim to improve the
perinatal outcome   it may not be practical or feasible for
every country center to adopt it universally   as per the
who   each health care facility need to assess their burden
of hyperglycemia in pregnancy and decide whether and how

the who have propose further strategy to overcome
barrier of ogtt testing with compromise on miss some
case of gdm 50 but again   the suggestion be make on the
basis of limited study   and the applicability of the result
of one study need to be evaluate in the indigenous population before a particular strategy be adopt   while develop
health care practice may follow a two step method   a onestep approach may be more useful for situation where access
or travel to health care center be limited or arduous   the
benefit of a second test   perform in a second visit   must
be balance against the cost and inconvenience of travel  
travel be also associate with health risk   however   if gct be
accomplish on routine antenatal visit   then a two step strategy may be beneficial in such case 5 the universal screening
to rule out overt diabete should   however   be adopt in
ethnicity country with a high prevalence of diabetes 13 we
summarize the pragmatic indication for the one   and twostep approach on the basis of a biopsychosocial model in
table 4 and an overall pragmatic approach base on guidance
from various professional body in figure 1  
 
future direction
it be feel that most guideline fail to address the need and constraint of low resource setting   where the demand for clear
and simple direction be the great   the screening protocol
be often base on evidence from scientific research carry
out by well resource academic institution   however   the
typical clinical setting in low   and middle income country
with poor resource and high disease burden face condition
that be often far away from these ideal setting   this call
into question the feasibility of apply screening procedure
and diagnostic criterion   future study need to address these
issue in great detail 50 datum on the preference of pregnant
woman for a particular diagnostic test be unavailable   future
study should also evaluate the impact of any strategy on
 
international journal of woman s health 2015 7
 
personal satisfaction   quality of life   or psychological aspect
of individual patient   patient preference   convenience of
test versus outcome of testing and treatment should also be
take into account   this be indeed an important future research
imperative as without patient compliance   evidence base
screen decision be useless   as per our clinical experience and that of other expert   pregnant woman be more
concerned about the outcome of their pregnancy than by the
relatively minor inconvenience of diagnostic testing   gdm
labeling and possible treatment of limited duration 14
the nih consensus panel identify as a priority the conduct of a new rct evaluate outcome in woman currently
classify as   normal   accord to prevalent we criterion but
who would be consider abnormal by the iadpsg and the
ada 18 the diagnosis of gdm be generally make in the late
second or early third trimester   early detection and treatment may potentially improve outcome   however   there be
a dearth of evidence in this area   well design study be
need to determine the most appropriate mean of test
for gdm in early pregnancy and to explore the outcome of
early treatment intervention  
the adoption of iadpsg criterion by some professional
organization be mainly due to potential benefit   to mother
and child   in the prevention of short term pregnancy and
perinatal outcome   datum on potential long term benefit to
the health of the mother and her offspring be still scarce  
future study and or follow up of previous cohort like the
hapo study could answer this question 14
 
summary
apart from the debate on other issue   the first step should be
the implementation of universal screening to identify more
severe case of gdm   this step will already be a major one

  11 12 19   22    crp be describe by some study   11 12  
to be a bmi independent risk factor   while in other study
the association of crp and diabete be significantly

crp concentration measure 9 month after delivery
be associate with the risk of postpartum diabete   crp
concentration be correlate with subject bmi   however  
and do not contribute to risk above that already confer
by bmi in a multivariate analysis   measurement of serum
crp concentration   therefore   do not appear to provide
additional benefit in estimate diabetes risk in woman
who have gdm   the discrepancy between our study and
the finding of pradham   11    in which crp concentration
be independent predictor of diabete in healthy middle aged woman may reflect the fact that the woman in our
study have a high a priori risk for diabetes and be
young than in the study of pradham  
of particular benefit to treatment and prevention of
diabetes be the finding that postpartum diabete risk in

obese and who require insulin therapy   all gdm woman
who require insulin during pregnancy or who be obese be
also at high risk for postpartum diabete and be likely to
benefit from postpartum monitoring   in light of effective
prevention of type 2 diabetes through lifestyle intervention
  23 30    similar intervention be likely to be effective in this
subgroup of gdm woman   consistent with this   the possibility of prevent diabete in woman with previous gdm
though pharmacological intervention have be investigate in the troglitazone in the prevention of diabetes

be use in treatment arm

objective    the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   vary in direct proportion with the prevalence of type 2 diabete in a give population or ethnic group   give that
the number of people with diabete worldwide be expect to increase at record level through
2030   we examine temporal trend in gdm among diverse ethnic group  
research design and method    kaiser permanente of colorado   kpco   have
use a standard protocol to universally screen for gdm since 1994   this report be base on
36 403 kpco singleton pregnancy occur between 1994 and 2002 and examine trend in
gdm prevalence among woman with diverse ethnic background  
result    the prevalence of gdm among kpco member double from 1994 to 2002

among the pima indians   the population
with the world s high incidence and
prevalence of type 2 diabetes in child
  14   and adult   15    most of the increase prevalence of childhood type 2
diabete in the last 30 year be attributable
to increase exposure to maternal diabete during pregnancy   14   
there be a general impression that the

conclusion    t h I s
study
show that the prevalence of gdm double between 1994 and 2002 among
woman of varied ethnic racial background live in colorado   very little of
this increase be due to change in the age
and ethnic distribution of screened preg  
 
nancy or a previous history of diagnose
gdm   importantly   the datum show an increase prevalence of gdm among four
race ethnic group   non hispanic white  
hispanic   african americans   and
asians   thus add to previous report
among american indians   14 26   
there be several strength to this
study   1   the availability of a computerized database that provide consistency
in datum collection   tracking   and management over time   18    and 2   an objective  
standardize screening and diagnostic
procedure with very high effectiveness
that have remain constant throughout
the study period   21 27    the observed
increase in gdm prevalence in this population be not due to change in ascertainment because screening have be
routinely offer to all kpco woman

standard criterion   20   be use to diagnose gdm since 1994   the observed
trend be not due to increase access to
the screening protocol over time   give
that the acquisition of screen by kpco
woman have not substantially change
over time   although the geographical area
serve by kpco have not change over
time   there be a substantial increase in
the proportion of screen pregnancy
among minority woman   table 1    however   the overall increase gdm prevalence be not cause by a high
proportion of screen high risk pregnancy in later versus early time period   as the trend be independent of
change in the ethnic distribution of the
population   table 3    moreover   the increase trend be significant in population with both high risk   hispanic  
african american   and asian   and low
risk   non hispanic white   for gdm and
type 2 diabetes   we be not able to assess the contribution to the observed
trend of potential change in the socioeconomic status of the kpco population  
it be   however   unlikely that the observed
trend be due to decrease socioeconomic status   give that the trend be
not explain by change in ethnicity  
and previous datum do not suggest an effect
of socioeconomic status on gdm risk   independent of race ethnicity   it be also very
unlikely that socioeconomic status
change be present and important
enough to determine an increase in gdm
prevalence in all racial ethnic group  
the present study describe a strong
cohort effect on the prevalence of gdm  
regardless of age and ethnicity   woman
bear more recently be at increase risk
for gdm diagnosis compare with
woman bear early   this finding probably reflect an increase exposure to risk
582
 
factor s   operate before childbeare
age   one of the strong risk factor for
gdm   28   be obesity   the prevalence of
which have be dramatically increase
over the last several decade   16 29    although colorado have the low estimate
prevalence of obesity in the nation   obesity among colorado woman more than
double between 1990 and 2001   29   
coincidently   the prevalence of selfreporte   nongestational   diabete increase markedly among colorado
adult   from 3 4   in 1994 to 5 1   in
2000   an increase observe in both sex
and all age and racial ethnic group   30   
our result on increase gdm prevalence over the same time period be consistent with the report trend in obesity
and type 2 diabete in colorado   the fact
that gdm prevalence be similar for the
two most recently bear cohort in our
study have several possible explanation  
1   not all the woman belong to the
 
figure 2 age specific prevalence of gdm by birth cohort

increase per year   17    although the proportion of screen pregnancy also increase over time and there be no formal
test for significant effect within each
race ethnic group   this study provide evidence that gdm be increase in northern california among woman of diverse
ethnic racial background   similar trend
over the same time period be observe
among pregnant woman who be member of the kaiser permanente health care

almost twofold increase risk of elevated
weight at 5   to 7 year old among child whose mother have untreated gdm  
whereas the association with treat
gdm be weak   similar to that of the
milder impair glucose tolerance  
while observational study can raise
the hypothesis that treatment of gdm
mitigate an otherwise high risk of child
obesity   only a randomize control
trial can address this hypothesis in an unconfounded manner   no such study exist   the aim of this study be to examine
the effect of the treatment of gdm on the
bmi of 4   to 5 year old child whose
mother participate in a randomized
control trial of treatment for mild
gdm in pregnancy   to achieve this aim  
we take advantage of the temporal and
geographic co existence of a randomized
control trial and a child height weight
surveillance system   give that the randomize intervention result in low
weight at birth   and that low birth
weight be associate with low bmi in
childhood   9    we hypothesize that the
intervention would also result in low
bmi at age 4   to 5 year old

conclusion    in this follow up
study of child whose mother participate in a randomize control trial   we
do not find that treatment of mild gdm
during pregnancy reduce bmi in 4   to
5 year old even though macrosomia at
birth be substantially low in the intervention group than the control group  
statistical power be adequate   the multivariable adjusted effect estimate for bmi
z score be 0 08 with a low 95   confidence limit of   0 29   thus we effectively
rule out any reduction in bmi great
than one fourth to one third of sd   which
equate to only 0 3   0 4 kg m2   also about

of 16   17 kg m2  
give that animal experiment and
many observational study suggest that
gdm may cause offspring obesity   it be
natural to wonder why the result of this
study be null   observational study
may overestimate treatment effect because of confound   minimize confound be the principal reason for do
randomize trial   because all mother in
achois have mild gdm   we could not
assess the effect of treatment of more severe gdm   which might be necessary to

program offspring obesity   another possibility be that postnatal factor that determine a child s height and weight   such as
diet and physical activity   overwhelm any
effect of treat gdm during pregnancy   we do not have datum on child behavior to assess this possibility  
alternatively   the long term effect of
gdm on childhood obesity and its reduction through treatment may not appear
until later in childhood   in study base
in a specialty clinic   metzger and colleague   5   observe that child of diabetic mother be heavy than
population control subject at birth   but
not at age 1   2   or 3 year   only in school
age do the excess weight reappear   likewise   in a study of pima indian sib pair  
association of gdm with high offspring bmi be apparent from age 9
year through early adulthood   but not at
6   9 year of age   4    consistent with
these observation   in the pre birth cohort study project viva   we recently report that child of mother with
gdm have less rapid weight gain in the
first 6 month of life than child of nondiabetic mother   14    the explanation
for the age associate disappearance and
re emergence of the association of gdm
with high child weight status be unknown   one possibility be that gdm have
differential effect on lean and fat mass in
the early year of life   in the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome
study   high maternal glucose level
be associate with the sum of skinfold
thickness at birth   a direct measure of
adiposity    15    among 3 year old child in project viva   gdm be associate
with increase systolic blood pressure
and the sum of skinfold thickness   a direct measure of adiposity   but not with bmi  
which comprise both lean and fat mass
  16    unfortunately   we could not directly
care diabetesjournal org
 
evaluate whether mild gdm cause high
bmi in later childhood in the present analysis because the cywhs surveillance of the
height and weight of the child do not
extend past 5 year of age  
a less likely explanation for null result be selection bias   we obtain outcome datum on few than half of south
australian achois subject   however  
difference accord to treatment group
at baseline and in the newborn period
be similar among participant and nonparticipant   and adjustment for a range
of covariate do not materially change effect estimate   these observation suggest
that loss to follow up do not substantially bias the result  
inaccurate outcome measurement be
also unlikely to explain the null result  
child and family health nurse measure
height and weight with standard protocol   moreover   while nondifferential error in exposure measurement can bias
estimate toward the null value   noise in
measurement of the outcome merely
make estimate less precise but do not
introduce bias  
it be also unlikely that the observed
effect of the achois intervention on infant outcome be the result of chance  
and that further child follow up reveal
the fallacy   the intervention reduce the
risk of several newborn morbidity in addition to macrosomia   include the primary outcome of fetal and neonatal
death and birth injury   10    also   recent
datum from a u s   base randomize trial
of the treatment of mild gdm show reduction in macrosomia   6 vs   14    
newborn fat mass   caesarean section   and
shoulder dystocia   although a composite
neonatal end point be not demonstrably
different in the intervention versus control group   17    consistency across these
two study suggest a real effect of gdm
 
treatment on important infant health
outcome  
to conduct this study   we recognize
that routine surveillance offer a lowcost way to obtain outcome datum for research study   this type of collaboration
have the potential to increase knowledge
and improve health by combine research study   public health program  
and surveillance activity  
measure health outcome among
child whose mother participate in
randomize trial during pregnancy be not
only the most direct way of confirm
animal experiment of prenatal programming   but also may reveal how to improve
child and adult health outcome by intervene at early stage of human development   in this study   however   we do not
substantiate our hypothesis that treatment of mild gdm during pregnancy reduce bmi in preschool age child  
study be need that involve long follow up of child whose mother participate in complete randomized trial of
gdm treatment   moreover   any newly design trial of treatment or prevention of
gdm would benefit from funding to follow the child long term with measure
of body composition

objective    the aim of this article be to define the metabolic phenotype of pregnant
woman with one abnormal value   oav   during an oral glucose tolerance test   ogtt   and to test
whether oav could be consider metabolically comparable to gestational diabetes mellitus
  gdm   or a specific entity between gdm and normal pregnancy  
 
g
 
estational diabetes mellitus   gdm  
be the most common metabolic
complication of pregnancy   occur up to 14   of pregnant woman   1   
woman with gdm have a great risk for
future development of diabetes   and pregnancy outcome be more commonly complicate by perinatal morbidity and
mortality   2    therefore   early identification of woman at risk of or actually develop gdm be strongly warrant   3   
great risk for gdm be confer by a
positive family history for diabetes   ethnicity   maternal age   and prepregnancy
overweight or obesity   4    universal
screening be recommend by performance of a 50 g glucose challenge test
  gct   between the 24th and 28th week of
gestation   5    a plasma glucose value
ⱖ7 7 mmol l 1 h after glucose ingestion
call for a confirmatory 3 h 100 g oral
glucose tolerance test   ogtt   with result interpret on the basis of the criterion of carpenter and coustan   6   
accord to these criterion   the diagnosis of gdm require that two or more of
the glucose value should be meet or exceed   whereas woman with only one
abnormal value for the 100 g 3 h ogtt
  oav   be consider as have the same
risk as woman with normal ogtt result  
this   however   be a matter of discussion  
some author have find no difference
  7 8    whereas other have notice that
woman with oav have increase obstetric complication and a high rate of
macrosomia and large for gestational age
infant compare with woman with
treat gdm   9   11   
the limited but still recognizable alteration in glucose tolerance in woman
with oav should indicate possible impairment of mechanism responsible for
glucose homeostasis   in woman with
gdm the coexistence of defect in insulin
sensitivity and insulin secretion have
be repeatedly demonstrate   12    on
the contrary   it have not yet be fully establish whether woman with oav may
represent an intermediate phenotype between normal woman and woman with
gdm   because limited datum be available

conclusion    the importance
of early detection and prompt intensive
treatment of gdm be universally recognize   19    base on these consideration
and on the peculiar change in glucose
homeostasis during pregnancy   specific
criterion have be adopt to diagnose
gdm on the basis of a 3 h ogtt   upon
diagnosis   blood glucose monitor   nutritional change and   if necessary   insulin
therapy be then initiate   20    strict glycemic control be necessary to reduce the
risk of fetal and maternal morbidity
bring about by maternal hyperglycemia  
despite all evidence on the importance of treat gdm   the current criterion
lead to a dichotomous diagnosis   leave
out a large number of woman with nondiagnostic isolated hyperglycemia   I e   
woman with a single altered ogtt glucose value   oav    nevertheless   the increase in plasma glucose level   even
those below the diagnostic threshold for
diabete in the second half of pregnancy  
be associate with a slight   but continuous   increase in the incidence of macrosomia and caesarean section   21    a link
between mild glucose intolerance and adverse maternal fetal outcome have be
epidemiologically suggest   22   
from these consideration   it appear
that a well understanding of the metabolic feature and risk of woman with
intermediate alteration in glucose homeostasis be warrant   to date only three

figure 2 issi   stumvoll first phase secretion index    isi matsuda   curve   accord to glucose
tolerance status  
 
woman with oav   have report investigation on the metabolic phenotype of
this population   we now report datum obtain in a large cohort of pregnant
woman with oav   n    759   compare
with those with gdm   n    726   or normal pregnancy   ngt   n    2 568    these
woman be refer to our diabetes clinic because they all have positive screening
test for gdm  
the first observation emerge from
this survey be that oav be not a trivial phenomenon as it occur at a rate   18 7   
comparable to that of gdm   17 9    
moreover   the two group be more than
alike   there be indeed no difference in
age   prevalence of overweight or obesity  
and weight gain during pregnancy   in
agreement with previous observation   in
our population too alteration of glucose
homeostasis occur in old and more
obese woman   23    moreover   lipid profile for oav and gdm be not distinguishable   high triglyceride concentration
have be previously report in woman
with gdm   24 25    the same be true for
woman with oav   whose triglyceride level be high than those for woman
with ngt and similar to those for woman
with gdm   suggest that similar pathogenetic mechanism   I e    impair insulin action   may be at work in both
condition  
this hypothesis be directly address by assess insulin sensitivity
and insulin secretion in this large caucasian population   use index derive
from the ogtt   we now show that in
go from one condition of glucose tolerance to another   both insulin sensitivity
and    cell function progressively decline  
insulin secretory capability be determine by calculation of the homa b index   a surrogate of basal insulin secretion  
and by the stumvoll first   and secondphase index   which reflect dynamic insulin response   with both approach   it
be quite clear that insulin secretion
tend to deteriorate with worsening of
glucose tolerance   confirm result obtain in a small study   14   
insulin secretion   however   must be
assess as a function of prevalent insulin
sensitivity as originally propose by kahn
et al    26    the product of the stumvoll
first phase index and the isi matsuda have
be propose as an issi during pregnancy by retnakaran et al    14    this index express the ability of the    cell to
compensate for insulin resistance   similarly to retnakaran et al    we observe in a
much large population that the issi be
 
 
di cianni and associate
 
diabetes care   volume 30   number 7   july 2007
 
pecially the 1 h oav subgroup   do not
reflect a metabolically normal population  
we could postulate that if we reevaluate
woman with oav later in pregnancy  
when insulin resistance increase as a result of placental activity   29    some oav
could be diagnose as gdm   in support of
such a hypothesis   there be epidemiological observation indicate an increase in
the prevalence of gdm in woman at high
risk when an ogtt be repeat later in
pregnancy   30    nevertheless   longitudinal study be need to define whether
this group of woman may have a great
risk of advancement toward an overtly diabetic status late in pregnancy or great
risk of develop type 2 diabete later in
life  
in summary   our result indicate that
the prevalence of oav and gdm be high
in pregnant woman with a positive glucose challenge test   woman with oav be
clinically indistinguishable from patient
with gdm   and both group be different
from the woman with ngt   both gdm
and oav group have impairment of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity  
although these defect be more pronounced in woman with gdm   these result should draw attention to the need
for well understanding of the risk associate with oav   particularly 1 h postogtt hyperglycemia   to define whether
intensive treatment should be recommend for these woman as well

the bayesian model assume that the
count in the expose and unexposed
group follow binomial distribution with
different mean probability   these mean
be model on the logit scale so that their
difference represent the logor and thus
be a hierarchical logistic regression model  
the mean and variance of the logor be
random variable in the bayesian model  
to represent our lack of prior knowledge
about the value of these hyperparameter  
we use diffuse prior that encompass a
wide range of possible value   for mean
and regression coefficient parameter  
these be normal distribution with
mean 0 and extremely large variance 107  
for the variance parameter   we use inverse     1 0   0 1   distribution   to compute the bayesian estimate   we use a
markov chain monte carlo algorithm
run three parallel chain and monitor convergence with the gelmanrubin diagnostic   20    on convergence  
which generally occur within 1 000
run   we save 15 000 sample from each
chain to estimate posterior distribution
of model parameter   the markov chain
monte carlo algorithm use be describe
in great detail by schmid et al    19   
we also conduct a bayesian metaregression analysis to assess whether the
relationship between obesity and gdm
vary by certain study characteristic   in
these model   the logor be relate to
the study characteristic by a linear regression model   these include date of
publication   1985 1999   2000   2003   or
2004   2006    study location   u s   versus
all other    type of datum collection   prospective versus retrospective    and gdm

figure 1 association of gdm with overweight versus normal maternal bmi  
 
the public health implication for the
u s   be significant because of the high
prevalence of obesity   increase prevalence of gdm   and the potential adverse
consequence associate with obesity
and gdm   include high risk of adverse infant outcome   high risk of diabete for the mother later in life   and a
high risk of diabetes and overweight
for the offspring  
fetal macrosomia be a common adverse infant outcome relate to gdm   especially if gdm be unrecognized and
untreated   5 7 41   43    for the infant  
macrosomia increase the risk of shoulder dystocia   clavical fracture   and brachial plexus injury and be also associate
with depressed 5 min apgar score and
increase rate of admission to neonatal
intensive care unit   44    for the mother  
the primary risk associate with macrosomia be an increase risk of cesarean delivery   these mother also have an increase
risk of postpartum hemorrhage and vaginal laceration   42   
also of concern be the finding from
several longitudinal study that infant of
woman with gdm be at increase risk of
become overweight or obese as young
child and adolescent   45   47   and be
more likely to develop type 2 diabetes
later in life   48   50    it have be suggest
that the relationship between decrease
insulin sensitivity and excessive fetal
growth in obese woman and woman with
diabetes care   volume 30   number 8   august 2007
 
gdm may explain some of the increase
incidence of obesity and glucose intolerance in their offspring   51    some of this
association be likely explain by other
factor associate with maternal obesity  
such as share genetic factor or similar
dietary and physical activity behavior in
family   9    however   if this association
do prove causal   an increase gdm
prevalence could far elevate type 2
diabete rate in future generation  
an increase in gdm prevalence also
have implication for prevention of type 2
diabete in woman who have have gdm  
because   50   of woman with a history
of gdm develop diabete within 5 10
year after delivery   10    the postpartum
period offer an opportunity to both
screen woman at an early stage for preexist diabete and to counsel woman
about type 2 diabetes prevention   both
the american college of obstetrician
and gynecologist and the american diabetes association have recommend
follow up glucose testing of woman with
a history of gdm   52 53    however   current postpartum gdm screening rate be
low   54   56    result in many missed
opportunity for counseling and treatment of woman who be at high risk for
type 2 diabetes   improve postpartum
follow up rate will require a well understanding of patient   provider   and
health care system barrier to postpartum
screen   56   
 
there be several possible bias to
consider in our analysis   first   the study
include in this meta analysis use vary weight and bmi category for normal  
overweight   obese   and severely obese
woman   thus   the pool estimate do
not exactly reflect the same comparison
for all study   in addition   because of the
different bmi weight category and different diagnostic criterion use for gdm  
there be likely some misclassification of
the exposure and the outcome   if significant   the finding would be bias toward
a null result or cause significant heterogeneity in the meta analysis model   the or
for the comparison between normalweight and overweight and obese woman  
respectively   be fairly consistent among
the study   suggest that the varied definition of exposure and outcome do not
have major effect on these finding   fig  
1 and 2    result be more disparate in
the comparison between normal weight
and severely obese woman   fig   3    although there be clearly a positive association between severe obesity and gdm   the
magnitude of the association vary
widely among study   hence   there be less
confidence in this summary measure than
for the other comparison   however   the
two outlying or be from study with
the small sample size  
a second limitation be that study do
not or could not   e g    birth registry  
specify whether all pregnant woman be

figure 2 association of gdm with obese versus normal maternal bmi  
 
screen for gdm or if screen be
do base on a risk profile   e g    previous adverse pregnancy outcome    riskbase screening could bias our finding if
screen be do preferentially on
overweight or obese woman compare
with normal weight woman   however  
because recommend risk base screen for gdm exclude relatively few
woman   as a practical matter   clinician
routinely screen all pregnant woman for
gdm   52    however   we be not able to
account for difference in screen practice   if they exist  
third   because not all study present adjusted odd and adjustment factor vary among those that do   we only
use crude study estimate in our meta  
 
analysis   if there be strong effect from
confound factor   e g    maternal age be
associate with both increase body
weight and risk of gdm    the estimate
include in the meta analysis might be bias   when we do a separate metaanalysis pooling study that provide
adjust or   the summary adjust or
be low than the unadjusted estimate  
although they be still of substantial
magnitude   overweight vs   normal adjust or 1 86   95   ci 1 22 2 78   
obese vs   normal adjust 3 34   2 43  
4 55    and severely obese vs   normal adjust 5 77   3 60   9 39     finally   our
finding may be bias because publish
study do not represent all study ever
do on a particular subject and because
 
statistically significant result be more
likely to be submit and publish than
nonsignificant and null result   57    if
study publication bias be strong   we
would overestimate the risk of gdm with
increase bmi  
in summary   our finding suggest that
gdm risk increase substantially with increase maternal bmi   the increase
prevalence of obesity and relate condition such as gdm and type 2 diabete in
the u s   be already change prediction
of the cost of medical care in the future
  58 59    prevent gdm depend on
prevent obesity in young woman   prevent type 2 diabete in obese woman
who have gdm depend on effective nutrition and physical activity intervention

objective    gestational diabetes mellitus   gdm   be an increasingly prevalent risk factor
for the development of type 2 diabetes in the mother and be responsible for morbidity in the child  
to well identify woman at risk of develop gdm we examine sociodemographic correlate

dictor of type 2 diabetes   woman with
gdm be up to six time more likely to
develop type 2 diabetes than woman with
normal glucose tolerance in pregnancy
  3    the incidence of gdm vary among
population   similar to the variation of
type 2 diabetes   with recent prevalence
estimate range from 2 8   of pregnant
woman in washington   dc   to 18 9   in
india and 22   in sardinia   italy   4    the
risk for gdm increase with age   and incidence rate vary by ethnicity within a
population   again similar to the risk for
type 2 diabetes   4 5    there be also evidence that obesity   parity   smoking   and
family history be risk factor for gdm
  5    however   less be know regard
the sociodemographic distribution of
gdm   give the strong link between
gdm and the subsequent risk of diabetes
for the mother and the perinatal morbidity for mother and child an association
recently update with finding of a continuous association of maternal glucose
level and adverse perinatal outcome
by the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome study cooperative
research group   6   a well understanding of the sociodemographic determinant of gdm may provide novel
opportunity to reduce the incidence and
to prevent the onset of type 2 diabete in
late life  
most study that have examine the
etiology of gdm have be hospital base
or have be base on sample of birth in
a particular region   4 5    there be currently no large   comprehensive population wide urban and rural dataset that
have be collect in an attempt to

correlate with socioeconomic status  
ethnicity   and maternal age   there be no
relationship with smoking and a small

study to show a strong correlation between gdm and socioeconomic status  
the relationship between the risk of
gdm with maternal region of country of

potential long term morbidity in the

australia   like the u s   and u k    have a
large   diverse   and increase immigrant
population   previous descriptive study
have show an increase association between gdm and many ethnicity   with
woman from asian   african   and hispanic
background be most at risk   5    our
study support these finding   and the
size of the immigrant population in nsw
allow we to reliably compare the risk of
gdm for woman bear all over the world  
in the current study   woman from across
asia have an increase risk of gdm compare with woman bear in australia and
new zealand   asian australian be also
find to have an increase risk for type 2
diabetes relative to caucasian australian
  12    approximately 6   of australia s
population be compose of people bear in
asia   from where an increase proportion of new migrant will continue to arrive   as well as from other region where
our study show woman have a great
risk of gdm   such as the middle east and
africa   however   it be likely our study have
underestimate the association of ethnicity and gdm   as woman bear in australia
of non caucasian background could not
be identify in our study   this group in  
 
clude indigenous australian   who be
also a group with a high risk for develop gdm   16   
the current study identify a strong
inverse association between socioeconomic status and gdm   low socioeconomic status be well recognize as a risk
for chronic disease in developed and develop country   17    the association
between gdm and socioeconomic status
be less well establish   with conflict
result see in previous study   these
study can not easily be compare because of different definition of socioeconomic status   but three study have use

  adjust for all other variable in table    reference category  
 
tion be maintain when the database
be stratify by region of country of birth
of the woman   with each group show a
very similar relationship between gdm
and socioeconomic status   for those
woman bear in region with the high
odd for gdm   all of asia and the pacific   
the socioeconomic status correlation be
not as evident as that for other woman  
with only a 23 38   increase risk for
low socioeconomic status   compare
with a risk of at least 55   in all other
woman   
the large difference in adjust or
between the high and all low socioeconomic status quartile but small difference between the three low quartile
may be due to bias create by use the
seifa of the postcode of residence as our
socioeconomic indicator   it be unlikely
that woman of low socioeconomic status
can afford to live in high socioeconomic
area   whereas woman of high income
and educational status may live in area
with a low seifa   hence   the methodology we use may have cloud the relationship with gdm risk among the
low socioeconomic quartile   obesity
may also be a factor   the australian insti  
 
tute for health and welfare estimate that
woman in the most disadvantaged socioeconomic group have double the rate of
obesity of those in the most advantaged
group   21    and obesity be a recognize
risk factor for gdm   the lack of datum on
pregestational weight or bmi of woman be
a limitation of this study but not unique to
study report the association of socioeconomic status with gdm   14 18 20   
however   in those study in which an adjustment for maternal weight be make  
the inverse association with socioeconomic status be still evident   13 15 19   
family history of diabetes have also be
report to be associate with gdm  
though we be not able to include this
factor in the present study  
in clinical study   parity have be describe as a risk factor for gdm   5    however   although epidemiological study
have also demonstrate this relationship  
it may not persist after adjustment for
other risk factor such as age and obesity
  15    our analysis show a positive association with parity in univariate analysis
that reverse to be a slight inverse association with adjustment for age   this finding suggest that there be additional
 
diabetes care   volume 31   number 12   december 2008
 
factor that influence the relationship between parity and gdm   one possibility be
that there be a large subgroup of woman
who have few child but have a high
risk of gdm   woman with polycystic
ovary syndrome might be in this group   as
they comprise up to 10   of woman of
reproductive age   be subfertile   and be
likely to develop gdm   there be indirect
datum to support this hypothesis   some
study have show that nulliparous
woman be more likely to develop diabete than multiparous woman   and   indeed   it have be postulate that
polycystic ovary syndrome contribute to
this effect   22   
during the year examine in the current study   the crude incidence of gdm
