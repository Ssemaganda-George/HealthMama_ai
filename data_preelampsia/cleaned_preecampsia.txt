•	 If in health centre II and III, give loading 
dose of magnesium sulphate and oral 
antihypertensive medication and refer 
to a higher facility. 
•	 At a higher facility (CEmONC facilties), 
admit and initiate delivery within 24 
hours 
•	 Mode of delivery should be based on 
obstetric assessment
•	 Assess foetal well-being (foetal 
movements, heart sounds, quantity of 
liquor, foetal growth) and maternal well￾being and deliver appropriately.
•	 If cervix is favourable, and no 
contraindications to vaginal delivery, 
induce labour with oxytocin
•	 If cervix is not favourable Ripen cervix 
with Prostaglandin E2 and deliver 
vaginally if there is no contraindication
•	 In the absence of prostaglandin 
E2, induce with 25 micrograms of 
misoprostol given every 6 hours 
vaginally for 24 hours or oral solution 
every 2 hours for 12 hours, 
•	 If there are contraindications to 
vaginal delivery, deliver by emergency 
caesarean section

Management of Pre-eclampsia without 
severe features before term (less than 
37 weeks gestation)
•	 If in health centre II and III, give loading 
dose of magnesium sulphate and oral 
antihypertensive medication and refer 
to a higher facility.

to see if she is fit for outpatient 
management which involves the 
following

not develop, deliver at 37 weeks 
•	 For mothers who may not be able to 
keep weekly appointments, they are 
better managed as inpatient 
Pre-eclampsia with severe features 
Management of Pre-eclampsia with severe 
features 
Note: Admit all patients with pre-eclampsia with severe 
features
Goal 1: Prevent & / or control convulsions/
fits/seizures 
•	 Give magnesium sulphate as follows 
•	 Loading dose: (if not yet given from 
referring unit) 14 g given as IV 4g of 
20% followed by IM 5g of 50% with 1ml 
of 2% lignocaine in each buttock. 
•	 Maintenance dose: IM 5g of 50% with 
1ml of 2% lignocaine in alternate buttock 
every 4 hours for 24 hours after delivery 
or last fit whichever occurred last 
•	 If patient convulses again before the 
next maintenance dose give IV 2g of 
20% & continue with the maintenance 
for 24 hours after delivery or last fit 
which ever occurred last. 
•	 However, if patient continues to 
convulse give IV Phenytoin 1g in 500mls 
of saline and consult critical care team. 
•	 Check for magnesium sulphate toxicity 
and signs of kidney failure before 
administration of subsequent doses 
- Hyporeflexia – reduced deep tendon 
reflexes 
- Respiratory depression (RR < 16 
breaths per minute)
- Oliguria (urine output less than 
<100mls in 4 hours) a sign of renal 
failure that can lead to toxicity, if 
present give half dose of magnesium 
sulphate.
•	 IF TOXICITY PRESENT, Stop MgSO4 and 
give calcium gluconate intravenously 
(1g of 10% over 10mins) always ensure 
calcium gluconate is available and not 
expired
Goal 2. Control blood pressure
•	 If BP ≥160/110mmHg, give IV Hydralazine 
5mg, repeat every 30 minutes until BP 
<160/110 mmHg, Max total dose is 30mg 
in 24 hours OR
•	 IV Labetalol 20mg, repeat as needed 
every 10 minutes, can double to 40mg, 
then 80mg, until BP <160/110mmg Max 
total dose is 300mg in24 hours OR
•	 Oral immediate release Nifedipine 10mg 
Repeat BP measurement at 20-minute 
intervals. Maximum 3 doses. If BP 
remains >160/110mmHg, at 20 mins, 
give 10 or 20 mg orally, depending on 
the initial response.
•	 Once BP <160/110 initiate oral medication 
with Nifedipine starting at 20 mg 12 
hourly, methyldopa at 250mg 8 hourly, 
labetalol starting 200mg 12 hourly or a 
combination of doses. Dosing should 
be adjusted according to the response 
observed. 
Essential Maternal and Newborn Clinical Care 
Guidelines for Uganda 23
•	 Target BP is 135/85 mmHg (130-139/ 
80-89 mmHg)
Goal 3: Plan for delivery
•	 If the mother is at or more than 37 
weeks of gestation, consider immediate 
delivery after stabilisation. Note that 
delivery should be initiated within 24 
hours
•	 Other indications for immediate delivery 
or contraindications for expectant 
management irrespective of gestational 
age 
- Abnormal neurological features 
(intractable headache refractory 
to treatment, repeated visual 
scotomata, eclampsia or stroke)
- Uncontrolled blood pressure of 
more than 160/110mmHg despite 
maintenance with three different 
classes of antihypertensive agents.
- Pulmonary oedema or SPO2 <90%, 
- Progressive or worsening 
thrombocytopenia <100,000 or 
need for transfusion
- Laboratory findings in (CBC, RFTs, & 
LFTs) in the severe range
- Non reassuring foetal status /
Abnormal foetal testing (e.g., 
NST or low BPP, IUGR, absent or 
reversed diastolic flow on umbilical 
artery Doppler or abnormal ductus 
venosus waveform) or intrauterine 
foetal death 
- Oligohydramnios AFI <5 cm or single 
deepest vertical pocket <2 cm), 
- Hemodynamic instability (shock), 
- Persistent epigastric/RUQ pain 
unresponsive to analgesics, 
- Myocardial infarction or 
cardiomyopathy, 
- Coagulopathy, 
- HELLP, 
- Placental abruption, 
- Preterm labour, 
- Preterm prelabour rupture of 
membranes, 
•	 For mothers at 34 to <37 weeks of 
gestation, offer expectant management 
in hospital if there is no indication for 
immediate delivery as listed above
Note: For mothers at 36 to < 37 weeks suggest to mother 
& caretaker initiation of delivery
•	 For mothers at 24 to <34 weeks of 
gestation, offer expectant management 
in hospital if there is no indication for 
immediate delivery as listed above
Components of expectant 
management 
•	 The mother must be admitted in hospital 
until delivery
•	 Carry out daily maternal and foetal 
assessment for indications for 
immediate delivery, 4 hourly monitoring 
of BP
•	 Do daily laboratory tests: CBC 
(Platelets), LFT (AST & ALT), RFT 
(Serum creatinine & electrolytes), 
•	 Administer corticosteroid (IM 
Betamethasone 12mg 12 hourly for 24 
hours OR IM Dexamethasone 6mg 12 
hourly for 48 hours)
•	 Control blood pressure with oral 
nifedipine or methyl dopa or labetalol or 
a combination with target BP of 135/85 
mmHg (130-139/80-89 mmHg)
•	 Ensure to complete maintenances dose 
of magnesium sulphate
•	 Do daily CTG if available, 
•	 Monitor fluid intake and urine output, 
•	 Do twice weekly ultrasound scan for 
foetal growth, BPP, umbilical artery 
doppler studies & NST, 
•	 Conduct immediate delivery if an 
indication for immediate delivery 
develops.
Intrapartum care 
•	 Route of delivery is based on standard 
obstetric assessment, 
•	 Continuous maternal-foetal (CGT) 
monitoring if feasible, 
•	 Treat severe hypertension promptly 
with intravenous antihypertensives, 
Neuraxial analgesia is generally safe 
and effective, Limit fluid intake to 60-
80mL/hr
Postpartum care and follow up
Immediate and intermediate: 
•	 Monitor vital signs every two hours, 
Essential Maternal and Newborn Clinical Care 
Guidelines for Uganda 24
REPRODUCTIVE AND CHILD HEALTH DEPARTMENT
then 4-6 hourly for at least 3 days and 
Complete magnesium sulphate dose. 
•	 Repeat laboratory tests CBC (Platelets), 
LFT (AST & ALT), RFT (Serum creatinine 
daily until two consecutive sets of data 
are normal or trending to normal, 
•	 Persistent severe hypertension should 
be treated, Tapper antihypertensives 
slowly after days 3 to 6
Short and long term follow up: 
•	 Review the mother postpartum within 1 
week, then every 2 weeks until 6 weeks 
and monthly until 3 months. 
•	 Repeat laboratory tests at each review .
•	 Counsel and provide appropriate 
contraceptive method 
•	 Further work up is dictated by persistent 
abnormalities including screening for 
secondary causes of hypertension or 
underlying renal disease with persistent 
proteinuria,
•	 Assess for depression, anxiety & PTSD.
•	 Offer information for increased risks 
for CVD, stroke, DM, VTE, & CKD, and 
SGA and recurrent pre-eclampsia in 
subsequent pregnancies. Counsel the 
mother that her risk of getting recurrent 
pre-eclampsia is 1 in 5 women 
•	 Regular preferably yearly follow up with 
to monitor BP, periodic fasting lipids 
and blood sugar. 
•	 Link to primary care physician 
appropriately (cardiologist in case of 
CVD or Nephrologist case of CKD 
Eclampsia
Differential Diagnosis
•	 Cerebral malaria: usually pyrexia, 
convulsions and a normal blood pressure
•	 Meningitis: headache, fever, stiff neck 
and normal blood pressure
•	 Epilepsy: convulsions, usually no fever 
and no hypertension, previous history 
of convulsions.
•	 Poisoning: coma, convulsions, normal 
blood pressure
•	 Diabetic coma: no convulsions, blood 
pressure may be high, glycosuria, 
ketonuria and hyperglycaemia.
Management of Eclampsia
•	 Call for help; Do not leave the woman 
alone
•	 Help her lie on the left lateral position 
and protect her from fall or injury
•	 Extend her neck and keep the head in 
a lateral position: keep the airway clear 
and apply a mouth gag. (Do not attempt 
this during a convulsion). This will also 
prevent tongue injury
•	 Ask assistant to bring pre-assembled 
emergency trolley 
•	 Administer magnesium sulphate or 
diazepam to control convulsions as per 
the regimen below
•	 Give hydralazine to control blood 
pressure (see management of severe 
PET)
•	 Establish an IV line and give normal 
saline or Ringer’s lactate
•	 Catheterize with Foleys catheter to 
monitor urine output, attach urine bag
•	 Perform bedside clotting time. The clot 
will normally form between 4 and 11 
minutes. Failure of the clot to form after 
11 minutes, or a soft clot that breaks 
down easily, suggests coagulation 
problems.
•	 Deliver when convulsions and BP are 
controlled using appropriate mode 
of delivery. Aim to achieve delivery 
within 12 hours from first convulsions. 
Caesarean delivery is indicated for any 
Essential Maternal and Newborn Clinical Care 
Guidelines for Uganda 25
additional obstetric indication or if 
delivery is not imminent
•	 Monitor vital signs half hourly and urine 
output hourly until delivered. Reduced 
urinary output (<30ml per hour) may be 
an indication of renal damage
•	 Continue anticonvulsant therapy for 24 
hours after last convulsion, or delivery 
whichever occurs last.
Drugs Used in Eclampsia
Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4) – drug of choice
•	 Indications
- To control convulsions
- To prevent convulsions in cases of 
severe pre-eclampsia 
•	 Loading Dose
- Give MgSO4, 4g IV as 20% solution 
over 20 minutes. If IV access is not 
available immediately, give the IM 
dose first.
- Follow promptly with 10 g of 50% 
MgSO4 solution, 5g in each buttock 
as deep IM injection with 1.0 ml of 
2% lignocaine.
- If convulsions occur after the loading 
dose, give 2g MgSO4 IV (20%) over 
20 minutes. 
- If patient continues to convulse give 
diazepam.
•	 Maintenance Dose
MgSO4 (5g of 50% solution and 1 ml 
lignocaine 2%) is given IM every 4 hours 
into alternate buttock. Before giving the 
dose, ensure that:
- Respiratory rate is 16 per minute or 
more;
- Urine output is 120 ml or more in the 
last 4 hours, i.e. 30ml per hour; and
- Patient tendon reflexes are present 
and normal
If any of the three conditions above are 
unsatisfactory, omit the dose. In case of 
respiratory depression (respiratory rate 
less than 16), give the antidote: Calcium 
gluconate 1g (10ml of 10% solution) IV 
slowly until respiration improves over 10 
minutes.

4g 8ml 12ml 20ml
Give Diazepam if MgSO4 is not available.
Note: Diazepam causes significant respiratory depression 
in neonates and should not be used unless magnesium 
sulphate is not available.
•	 Loading dose
- Give Diazepam 10mg IV over 2 
minutes
- If the convulsions recur, repeat the 
same loading dose
•	 Maintenance dose
- Give diazepam, 40mg in 500ml of 
normal saline and titrate to keep the 
patient sedated, but rousable
- Remember that maternal respiratory 
depression may occur when doses 
exceed 30 mg in 1 hour. If this occurs, 
ventilate patient (face mask/bag, 
anaesthesia apparatus, intubation, 
etc.) until spontaneous respiration is 
satisfactory
Note:
1. Anti-hypertensives: Administered as for Pre-eclampsia 
with severe symptoms as stated above
2. Investigate and follow up as stated for Pre￾eclampsia with severe symptoms
Precautions to take in order to avoid 
complications
•	 Give hypertensive treatment to lower 
the blood pressure close to normal 
over 12 hours to reduce risk of stroke or 
foetal death
•	 Do not use diuretics except in cardiac 
and renal failure
•	 In severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, 
control the pressure and fits and 
terminate the pregnancy within 24 
hours irrespective of the gestational 
age.
Essential Maternal and Newborn Clinical Care 
Guidelines for Uganda 26
REPRODUCTIVE AND CHILD HEALTH DEPARTMENT
•	 Catheterise to monitor urine output
•	 Use magnesium sulphate as first line 
drug where available to control fits 
and even for prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia. The second-best drug is 
diazepam
•	 Do not use Ketamine as an anaesthetic 
drug in eclampsia
Prevention or risk reduction of preeclampsia 
in the antenatal period 
High risk factors:
•	 Previous pregnancy with preeclampsia, 
especially early onset and with an 
adverse outcome.
•	 Multifetal gestation.
•	 Chronic hypertension.
•	 Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus.
•	 Chronic kidney disease.
•	 Autoimmune disease with 
potential vascular complications 
(antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic 
lupus erythematosus).
Moderate risk factors
•	 Nulliparity.
•	 Obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2).
•	 Family history of preeclampsia in 
mother or sister.
•	 Age ≥35 years.
•	 Sociodemographic characteristics 
(African American race, low 
socioeconomic level).
•	 Personal risk factors (eg, previous 
pregnancy with low birth weight or 
small for gestational age infant, previous 
adverse pregnancy outcome [e.g., 
stillbirth], interval >10 years between 
pregnancies).
Note: 
Administer low dose aspirin 75mg once daily for a mother 
with any one of the high-risk factors or a mother with any 
two of the moderate risk mothers. Start from 11 weeks of 
gestation but before 16 weeks of gestation. Stop the aspirin 
at 36 weeks of gestation
Management of Hypertensive Disorders other than PET/
Eclampsia
•	 Emergency care may be necessary 
if a patient has stroke or malignant 
hypertension. Give hypertensive 
therapy or treatment with hydralazine 
or nifedipine and arrange to deliver 
the mother or transfer to emergency 
obstetric care facilities.
Before 37 completed weeks:
•	 Maintain antihypertensive therapy
•	 Consult physician and manage jointly
•	 Monitor pregnancy progress, the foetus 
may often be small for gestation age
•	 Counsel the mother or couple about the 
need to deliver at term 
•	 See every two weeks
At 37-40 weeks gestation:
•	 Maintain antihypertensive therapy
•	 Await spontaneous labour
•	 If blood pressure control is poor, admit 
to the emergency obstetric care facility 
and arrange delivery
•	 Pregnancy should not exceed 40 weeks. 
If she has completed 40 weeks, arrange 
delivery.
